At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
there was a nun who, after walking for almsfood, spread out her moist robe and entered her dwelling.
A second nun put on that robe and entered the village for almsfood.
Soon afterwards the first nun came out and asked the nuns,
“Venerables, have you seen my robe?”
The nuns told her what had happened.
She then complained and criticized the second nun,
“How can a nun put on my robe without asking permission?”
She told the nuns what had happened,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun put on another nun’s robe without asking permission?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can a nun do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun wears a robe taken on loan, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.

if she wears any of the five robes belonging to a fully ordained nun, and it has not been given to her, nor has she asked permission to use it, she commits an offense entailing confession.

The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can Venerable Caṇḍakāḷī socialize with a householder and their child?” …

After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that nun who has twelve years of seniority should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I, the nun so-and-so who has twelve years of seniority, ask the Sangha for approval to give the full admission.’
And she should ask a second

The Sangha should then decide whether that nun is competent and has a sense of conscience.
If she is ignorant and shameless, approval should not be given.
If she is ignorant but has a sense of conscience, approval should not be given.
If she is competent but shameless, approval should not be given.
If she is competent and has a sense of conscience, approval should be given.

At one time when the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof,
Venerable Upāli’s preceptor, Venerable Kappita, was staying in a charnel ground.
At that time the leader of the nuns from the group of six had just died.
They took her to that charnel ground, cremated her near Venerable Kappita’s dwelling, and made a stupa. They then went there to cry.
Venerable Kappita was disturbed by the noise, and so he demolished the stupa and scattered the rubble.
The nuns from the group of six thought,
“Kappita has demolished our Venerable’s stupa; let’s kill him,” and they laid a plan.
A certain nun told Venerable Upāli what was happening,
and he in turn told Venerable Kappita.
Venerable Kappita then left his dwelling and went into hiding.
Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six went to his dwelling
and crushed it with rocks and lumps of earth. When they thought he was dead, they left.
The following morning Venerable Kappita robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for almsfood.
When the nuns from the group of six saw him,
they said,
“Kappita is alive! Who foiled our plan?”
When they heard
it was Venerable Upāli,
they abused him,
“How could this barber, this dirt remover of inferior birth, foil our plan?”

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time a certain nun was associating with a family from which she received a regular meal.
Then, after robing up one morning, she took her bowl and robe and went to that family, where she sat down on a seat. She then departed without taking leave of the owners.
Soon afterwards, a slave-woman who was sweeping the house put that seat in between some vessels.
Not seeing the seat, the people there asked that nun,
“Venerable, where’s that seat?”
“I don’t know.”
“Give back the seat, Venerable.” And after scolding her, they made an end of her regular meal.
Then, while those people were cleaning the house, they saw that seat in between those vessels. They asked that nun for forgiveness and restored her regular meal.
That nun then told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to trainee nuns who had trained in the six rules for two years, but who had not been approved by the Sangha.
The nuns said,
“Come, trainee nuns, find out about this,” “Give this,” “Bring this,” “There’s need for this,” or “Make this allowable.”
But they replied,
“Venerables, we’re not trainee nuns. We’re nuns.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns give the full admission to trainee nuns who have trained for two years in the six rules, but who haven’t been approved by the Sangha?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can nuns do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, approval is required for the full admission of a trainee nun who has trained for two years in the six rules.
And it should be given like this.
After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that trainee nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I, the trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, ask the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.’
And she should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained under Venerable so-and-so for two years in the six rules, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval for the trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained for two years in the six rules, to be fully admitted.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained under Venerable so-and-so for two years in the six rules, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.
The Sangha gives approval for the trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained for two years in the six rules, to be fully admitted.
Any nun who approves of giving approval for the trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained for two years in the six rules, to be fully admitted should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given approval for the trainee nun so-and-so, who has trained for two years in the six rules, to be fully admitted.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways for being difficult to support …
“And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun gives the full admission to a trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years, but who has not been approved by the Sangha, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Thullanandā gave the full admission to a trainee nun who had not been given permission by her parents and her husband.
They complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā give the full admission to that trainee nun without our permission?”
The nuns heard the complaints of the parents and the husband.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā give the full admission to a trainee nun who doesn’t have permission from her parents and her husband?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,

This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …

The training rule on trainee nuns
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to trainee nuns who had not trained for two years in the six rules.
They were ignorant and incompetent, and did not know what was allowable and what was not.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns give the full admission to trainee nuns who haven’t trained for two years in the six rules?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can nuns do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, approval is required for a trainee nun to train in the six rules for two years.
And it should be given like this.
After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that trainee nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I, so-and-so, am a trainee nun under Venerable so-and-so.
I ask the Sangha for approval to train for two years in the six rules.’
And she should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so, who is a trainee nun under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so, who is a trainee nun under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years.
The Sangha gives approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years.
Any nun who approves of giving approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
That trainee nun should then be told to say this:
‘I undertake to abstain from killing living beings for two years without transgression.
I undertake to abstain from stealing for two years without transgression.
I undertake to abstain from sexual activity for two years without transgression.
I undertake to abstain from lying for two years without transgression.
I undertake to abstain from alcohol, which causes heedlessness, for two years without transgression.
I undertake to abstain from eating at the wrong time for two years without transgression.’”
Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways for being difficult to support …
“And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun gives the full admission to a trainee nun who has not trained in the six rules for two years, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
Two years:
two twelve-month periods.
Who has not trained:
the training has not been given to her, or the training has been given to her, but she has failed in it.
Gives the full admission:
gives the full ordination.
If, intending to give the full admission, she searches for a group, a teacher, a bowl, or a robe, or she establishes a monastic boundary, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When the last announcement is finished, the preceptor commits an offense entailing confession,
and the group and the teacher commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, and she gives the full admission, she commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, and she gives the full admission, she commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as illegitimate, and she gives the full admission, she commits an offense entailing confession.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Bhaddā Kāpilānī had entered the rainy-season residence at Sāketa.
But because she was disturbed by a certain matter, she sent a message to the nun Thullanandā:
“If you would give me a dwelling place, I would come to Sāvatthī.”
Thullanandā replied,
“Please come; I’ll give you one.”
Bhaddā Kāpilānī then traveled from Sāketa to Sāvatthī,
and Thullanandā gave her a dwelling place.
At that time Thullanandā was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings.
Bhaddā Kāpilānī, too, was a learned reciter who was confident and skilled at giving teachings, and she was respected for her excellence.
Because of this, people visited Bhaddā Kāpilānī first and then Thullanandā.
Overcome by jealousy, Thullanandā thought,
“These ones, who are supposedly contented and have few desires, who are supposedly secluded and not socializing, are always persuading and convincing people.” And in anger she threw Bhaddā Kāpilānī out of that dwelling place.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā give a dwelling place to Venerable Bhaddā Kāpilānī and then throw her out in anger?” …

The training rule on entering monasteries
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a number of monks dressed only in a sarong were making robes in a certain village monastery.
Nuns entered that monastery without asking permission and approached those monks.
The monks complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns enter a monastery without asking permission?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns did that?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can nuns do that?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun enters a monastery without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
Soon afterwards those monks left that monastery.
But even though the nuns knew that the monks had left, they did not go there.
Soon the monks returned.
When the nuns knew that this was the case, they asked permission and then entered that monastery.
They approached the monks and bowed down to them.
The monks then said to them, “Sisters, why didn’t you sweep the monastery, or put out water for drinking or water for washing?”
“The Buddha has laid down a training rule that we may not enter a monastery without asking permission.
That’s why we didn’t do it.”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks:
“Monks, when a monk is available, a nun should enter a monastery only after asking permission.
And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun, when a monk is available, enters a monastery without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
Soon afterwards those monks left that monastery once more, before returning once again.
Thinking that the monks were still away, the nuns entered the monastery without asking permission.
The nuns became anxious, thinking,
“We have entered a monastery without asking permission, even though a monk was available. And the Buddha has laid down a training rule against this.
Could it be that we have committed an offense entailing confession?”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun, knowing that there are monks in a monastery, enters it without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”

repeatedly said she would sew it, she neither sewed it herself, nor did she make any effort to have someone else do it.
That nun then told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized Thullanandā,

“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can the nun Thullanandā act like this?

And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun, after unstitching a nun’s robe or having it unstitched, neither sews it herself nor makes any effort to have someone else sew it, then, if there was no obstruction or it was no more than four or five days, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”

The training rule on garlic
Venerables, these one hundred and sixty-six rules on offenses entailing confession come up for recitation.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time a lay follower had invited the Sangha of nuns to ask for garlic:
“If any of the nuns need garlic, I’ll supply it.”
And he had told his field-keeper,
“If the nuns come, give two or three bulbs to each nun.”
On that occasion they were holding a celebration in Sāvatthī,
and the garlic was used up as soon as it arrived there.
Just then the nuns went to that lay follower and said,
“We need garlic.”
“Venerables, there isn’t any.
As soon as the garlic arrives, it’s used up.
Please go to the field.”
The nun Thullanandā went to the field, and not having any sense of moderation she took a large amount of garlic.
The field-keeper complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic?”
The nuns heard the complaints of that field-keeper,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“How could the nun Thullanandā not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after giving a teaching he addressed the monks:
“Once upon a time, monks, Thullanandā was the wife of a brahmin.
They had three daughters,
Nandā, Nandavatī, and Sundarīnandā.
When that brahmin eventually died, he was reborn as a goose,
whose feathers were all made of gold.
And he gave his former family members one feather at the time.
Thullanandā considered this. She then grabbed hold of that king of geese and plucked him.
But when his feathers regrew they were white.
At that time too, monks, Thullanandā lost her gold because she was too greedy.
Now she will lose her garlic.”
“One should be content with what one gets,
Because excessive greed is bad.
After grabbing hold of the king of geese,
The gold came to an end.”
Then, after criticizing the nun Thullanandā in many ways for being difficult to support …
the Buddha said, “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun eats garlic, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to married girls who were more than twelve years old and who had trained in the six rules for two years, but who had not been approved by the Sangha.
The nuns said,
“Come, trainee nuns, find out about this,” “Give this,” “Bring this,” “There’s need for this,” or “Make this allowable.”
But they replied,
“Venerables, we’re not trainee nuns. We’re nuns.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns give the full admission to married girls who are more than twelve years old and who have trained for two years in the six rules, but who haven’t been approved by the Sangha?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can nuns do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, approval should be given for the full admission of a married girl who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules.
And it should be given like this.
After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that married girl who is more than twelve years old should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I, the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, ask the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.’
And she should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.
The Sangha gives approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted.
Any nun who approves of giving approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given approval for the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways for being difficult to support …
“And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun gives the full admission to a married girl who is more than twelve years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules, but who has not been approved by the Sangha, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”

The training rules on asking for oil … honey … syrup … fish … meat … milk … curd
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nuns from the group of six were eating oil that they had asked for.
… were eating honey that they had asked for.
… were eating syrup that they had asked for.
… were eating fish that they had asked for.
… were eating meat that they had asked for.
… were drinking milk that they had asked for.
… were eating curd that they had asked for.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns eat curd that they have asked for?
Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?”
The nuns heard the complaints of those people.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns from the group of six eat curd that they have asked for?” …
“Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can the nuns from the group of six do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun asks for curd and then eats it, she must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
Soon afterwards a number of nuns were sick.
The nuns who were looking after them asked,
“We hope you’re bearing up; we hope you’re getting better?”

But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t ask because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” …
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick nun to eat curd that she has asked for.
And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun who is not sick asks for (oil …
curd and then eats it, she must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”

The training rule on asking for ghee
Venerables, these eight rules on acknowledgment come up for recitation.
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nuns from the group of six were eating ghee that they had asked for.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns eat ghee that they have asked for?
Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?”
The nuns heard the complaints of those people.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns from the group of six eat ghee that they have asked for?” …
“Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can the nuns from the group of six do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun asks for ghee and then eats it, she must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
Soon afterwards a number of nuns were sick.
The nuns who were looking after them asked,
“We hope you’re bearing up; we hope you’re getting better?”
“Previously we ate ghee that we had asked for, and then we were comfortable.
But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t ask because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” …
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick nun to eat ghee that she has asked for.
And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

The chapter on undetermined offenses
The second undetermined training rule
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At this time Venerable Udāyī knew that the Buddha had prohibited sitting alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action, and so instead he sat alone in private with the same girl. When they were able, they just chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching.
A second time Visākhā had been invited to that family.
When she arrived, she saw Udāyī sitting alone in private with the same girl,
and she said to Udāyī,
“Venerable, it’s not appropriate for you to sit alone with a woman on a private seat.
Although you may not be aiming at that act, people with little confidence are hard to convince.”
But Udāyī did not listen.
After leaving, Visākhā told the monks what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private seat?”
After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private seat?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you sit alone with a woman on a private seat?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘Although a seat is not concealed, nor suitable for action, it may be suitable for speaking indecently to a woman.
If a monk sits alone with a woman in private on such a seat, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him
and accuses him of an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession,
then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these two
or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said.
This rule too is undetermined.’”

The chapter on undetermined offenses
The first undetermined training rule
Venerables, these two undetermined rules come up for recitation.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.
One of those families that supported him had given their daughter in marriage to the son of another family.
Just then Venerable Udāyī robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to the first of those families. When he arrived, he asked
where the daughter was,
and he was told
that she had been given to another family.
That family too supported Venerable Udāyī.
He then went there and again asked
where the girl was.
They said,
“She’s sitting in her room.”
He approached that girl, and the two of them sat down alone on a private and concealed seat suitable for action. When they were able, they just chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching.
At that time Visākhā Migāramātā had many healthy children and grandchildren, and she was considered very auspicious.
At sacrifices, ceremonies, and celebrations people would feed Visākhā first.
And just then she had been invited to the family that supported Venerable Udāyī.
When she arrived, she saw him sitting alone with that girl,
and she said to him,
“Venerable, it’s not appropriate for you to sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action.
Although you may not be aiming at that act, people with little confidence are hard to convince.”
But Udāyī did not listen.
After leaving, Visākhā told the monks what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action?”
After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you sit alone with a woman on a such a seat?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk sits alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him
and accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion or an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession,
then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these three
or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said.
This rule is undetermined.’”

At that time a brahmin had prepared a milk drink for the Sangha.
The monks drank the milk making a slurping sound.
A monk who was previously an entertainer made a joke of it, saying,
“It’s as if the whole sangha were cooled.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk joke about the Sangha?” …
“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, you should not joke about the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a number of monks were sick.
The monks who were looking after them asked,
“We hope you’re bearing up; we hope you’re getting better?”
“Previously we ate rice and bean curry that we ourselves had asked for, and then we were comfortable.
that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t ask because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat rice and bean curry that he himself has asked for.

“Once upon a time in Bārāṇasī, monks, there was a low-caste man whose wife became pregnant.
She said to him,
‘I’m pregnant.
I crave mangoes.’
‘But there are no mangoes. It’s the wrong season.’
‘If I don’t get any, I’ll die.’
At that time the king had a mango tree that was always bearing fruit.
Then that low-caste man went to that mango tree, climbed it, and hid himself.
Just then the king and his brahmin counselor went to that same mango tree. There the king sat on a high seat while learning the Vedas.
The low-caste man thought,
‘How wrong-headed this king is, in that he sits on a high seat while learning the Vedas.
And the brahmin is wrong-headed too, in that he sits on a low seat while teaching the the Vedas to one sitting on a high seat.
And I’m wrong-headed too, in that I steal mangoes from the king because of a woman.
This is all so low!’
And he fell out of the tree right there.
‘Neither understands what is good,
Neither sees the Truth:
Not he who teaches the Vedas,
Nor he who learns improperly.’
‘I’ve eaten the finest rice,
With a curry of pure meat:
Therefore I’m not practicing the Teaching,
The Teaching praised by the Noble Ones.’
‘A curse it is the obtaining of wealth,
And the obtaining of fame, too, brahmin;
These things come with a low rebirth,
Or with wrong-headed behavior.
‘Go forth, great brahmin,
Other beings will do the cooking;
Don’t go against the Teaching,
Because you’ll break like a jar.’
Even at that time, monks, I was displeased by someone teaching the Vedas while sitting on a low seat to someone sitting on a high seat. How, then, could it not be displeasing now?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘“I will not give a teaching while sitting on a low seat to anyone sitting on a high seat who is not sick,” this is how you should train.’”
One should not give a teaching while sitting on a low seat to anyone sitting on a high seat who is not sick.

At that time the monks from the group of six ate sticking out their tongues. …
“‘I will not eat sticking out my tongue,’ this is how you should train.”
One should not eat sticking out one’s tongue.
If a monk, out of disrespect, eats sticking out his tongue, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if it is unintentional;
if he is the first offender.
The ninth training rule is finished.

“‘I will not cover my head while walking in inhabited areas,’ this is how you should train.”
One should not cover one’s head while walking in an inhabited area.
If a monk, out of disrespect, covers his head with his upper robe while walking in an inhabited area, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

Venerables, these four rules on acknowledgment come up for recitation.
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a certain nun was returning from almsround in Sāvatthī. She saw a monk and said to him,
“Here, Venerable, please take some almsfood.”
Saying, “Alright, Sister,” he took everything.
But because the time for eating was coming to an end, she was not able to go for alms, and she missed her meal.
The next day
and the following day the same thing happened again.
On the fourth day that nun was walking along a street, trembling.
A prominent merchant coming by carriage in the opposite direction saw her and shouted out,
“Watch out, Venerable!”
As she stepped aside, she collapsed right there.
And the merchant asked her for forgiveness:
“Forgive me, Venerable, since you fell because of me.”
“I didn’t fall because of you,
but because I’m weak.”
“But why are you so weak?”
The nun told him what had happened.
He then brought her to his house and gave her a meal. Afterwards he complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the venerables receive food directly from a nun?
It’s difficult for women to get material support.”
The monks heard the complaints of that merchant,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized that monk,
“How can a monk receive food directly from a nun?” …
“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
“Is she a relative of yours?”
“No, Sir.”
“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and what’s inappropriate in dealing with each other, what’s right and what’s wrong.
So how can you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk receives staple or non-staple food directly from an unrelated nun who has entered an inhabited area, and then eats it, he must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Unrelated:
anyone who is not a descendant of one’s male ancestors going back seven generations, either on the mother’s side or on the father’s side.
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas.
An inhabited area:
a street, a cul-de-sac, an intersection, a house.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics, the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
If he receives the food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If she is unrelated and he perceives her as such, and he receives staple or non-staple food directly from her when she has entered an inhabited area, and then eats it, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If she is unrelated, but he is unsure of it, and he receives staple or non-staple food directly from her when she has entered an inhabited area, and then eats it, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If she is unrelated, but he perceives her as related, and he receives staple or non-staple food directly from her when she has entered an inhabited area, and then eats it, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he receives staple or non-staple food, with the intention of eating it, directly from a nun who is fully ordained only on one side,
he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is related, but he perceives her as unrelated, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is related, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is related, and he perceives her as such, there is no offense.
if she has someone else give it and does not give herself;
if she gives by placing it near;
if it is inside a monastery;
if it is at the dwelling place of nuns;
if it is at the dwelling place of the ascetics of another religion;
if it is on returning to the monastery;
if she gives after carrying it out of the village;
if she gives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics, saying, “When there’s a reason, make use of these;”
if it is a trainee nun;
if it is a novice nun;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.

The fourth training rule on acknowledgment
At one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery,
the slaves of the Sakyans were rebelling.
The Sakyan women wished to prepare a meal at the wilderness dwellings,
but the slaves heard about this
and infested the path.
When the Sakyan women took various kinds of nice food and set out for a wilderness dwelling,
the slaves emerged, and they robbed and raped those Sakyan women.
Soon afterwards the Sakyan men came out, and they got hold of those criminals together with their loot. They then complained and criticized the monks,
“How can they not announce that there are criminals staying in the monastery?”
The monks heard the complaints of the Sakyans
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. If a monk, without first making an announcement about those dwellings, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, he must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a monk in a wilderness dwelling was sick.
People took staple and non-staple food and went to that wilderness dwelling,
and they invited that monk to eat.
But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited the eating of staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. And being unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal.
He then told the monks what had happened,
and they in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick monk, without first making an announcement, to eat staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. If a monk who is not sick, without first making an announcement about those dwellings, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, he must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
There are wilderness dwellings:
a wilderness dwelling: if it is at least 800 meters away from any inhabited area.
in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, criminals have been seen camped, eating, standing, seated, or lying down.
Dangerous:
in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, criminals have been seen injuring, robbing, or beating people.
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
About those dwellings:
about such kinds of dwellings.
Without making an announcement:
if an announcement is made to any of one’s five co-monastics, this is called “without making an announcement”.
If an announcement is made about anything apart from the monastery or its vicinity, this is called “without making an announcement”.
Making an announcement:
if a woman or a man comes to the monastery or the vicinity of the monastery and says, “Venerable, they’ll bring so-and-so’s staple or non-staple food,” then, if it is risky, this should be declared, and if it is dangerous, that should be declared.
If the person says, “Never mind, it will be brought,” then the criminals are to be told, “People are coming here; go away.”
When an announcement has been made in regard to rice porridge, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”.
When an announcement has been made in regard to rice, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”.
When an announcement has been made in regard to non-staple food, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”.
When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular family, then when any person from that family brings staple or non-staple food, this is called “announced”.
When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular village, then when any person from that village brings staple or non-staple food, this is called “announced”.
When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular association, then when any person from that association brings staple or non-staple food, this is called “announced”.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
Inside that monastery:
if the monastery is enclosed, then within the enclosure.
If the monastery is unenclosed, then in the vicinity.
Who is not sick:
who is able to walk for alms.
Who is sick:
who is unable to walk for alms.
If, without making an announcement, one who is not sick receives staple and non-staple food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If there has been no announcement, and he does not perceive that there has, and he, not being sick, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If there has been no announcement, but he is unsure of it, and he, not being sick, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If there has been no announcement, but he perceives that there has, and he, not being sick, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there has been an announcement, but he does not perceive that there has, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there has been an announcement, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there has been an announcement, and he perceives that there has, there is no offense.
if there has been an announcement;
if he eats the leftovers from where there has been an announcement or from one who is sick;
if he receives the food outside the monastery and then eats it inside;
if he eats a root, bark, a leaf, a flower, or a fruit originating in that monastery;
if he uses post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics when there is a reason;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The fourth training rule entailing acknowledgment is finished.
“Venerables, the four rules on acknowledgment have been recited.
In regard to this I ask you,
‘Are you pure in this?’
A second time I ask,
‘Are you pure in this?’
A third time I ask,
‘Are you pure in this?’
You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”

The third training rule on acknowledgment
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time in Sāvatthī there was a family where both the husband and the wife had confidence.
They were growing in faith, but declining in wealth. Whatever food they had in the morning, they gave to the monks. Sometimes they went without food.
People complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics not have a sense of moderation in receiving offerings?
After giving to them, these people sometimes go without.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, if a family’s faith is growing, but its wealth is declining, I allow you to designate it as ‘in training’, through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement.
And the designation should be given like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate that family as “in training”.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth.
The Sangha designates that family as “in training”.
Any monk who approves of designating that family as “in training” should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha designates such-and-such a family as “in training”.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards there was a celebration in Sāvatthī
and people invited the monks for a meal.
And so did the family that had been designated as in training.
But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept.
That family complained and criticized them,
“What is it with us that they don’t receive from us?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, if you have been invited, I allow you to eat staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without first being invited, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a certain monk was associating with that family.
One morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, went to them, and sat down on a prepared seat.
Just then that monk was sick,
and so they invited him to eat.
But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited an uninvited monk from eating staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept.
And being unable to walk for alms,
he missed his meal.
He then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened,
who in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without being sick and without first being invited, eats staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it:
“I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’”
There are families that are designated as “in training”:
a family designated as in training: a family in which the faith is growing but the wealth is declining.
Such a family is designated as “in training” through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement.
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Such a family:
that kind of family.
Without being invited:
not invited for later on the same day or for the following day, but only after entering the vicinity of the house—this is called “without being invited”.
invited for later on the same day or for the following day, but not after entering the vicinity of the house—this is called “invited”.
Without being sick:
who is able to walk for alms.
who is unable to walk for alms.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
If, without being sick and without being invited, he receives staple or non-staple food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.

The second training rule on acknowledgment
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time, when families invited monks to meals,
the nuns from the group of six were directing people toward the monks from the group of six, saying,
“Give curry here; give rice here.”
The monks from the group of six ate as much as they wanted,
but not so the other monks.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six not restrain the nuns from giving directions?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you didn’t do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you not do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When monks eat at invitations to families, if a nun is there giving directions, saying, “Give bean curry here; give rice here,” then those monks should stop her: “Stop, Sister, while the monks are eating.” If not even a single monk addresses that nun in this way to stop her, they must acknowledge it:
“We have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing which is to be acknowledged. We acknowledge it.”’”
When monks eat at invitations to families:
a family: there are four kinds of family: the aristocratic family, the brahmin family, the merchant family, the worker family.
Eat at invitations:
eat any of the five staple foods at invitations.
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas.
Giving directions:
saying, “Give bean curry here; give rice here,” according to friendship, according to companionship, according to whom one is devoted to, according to being a co-student, according to being a co-pupil—this is called “giving directions”.
Those monks:
the monks who are eating.
the nun who is giving directions.
Those monks should stop her: ‘Stop, Sister, while the monks are eating’:
if she is not stopped by even one monk, and a monk then receives food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If she is fully ordained, and he perceives her as such, and he does not restrain her from giving directions, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If she is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he does not restrain her from giving directions, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If she is fully ordained, but he does not perceive her as such, and he does not restrain her from giving directions, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment.
If he does not restrain a nun who is fully ordained only on one side from giving directions, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is not fully ordained, but he perceives her as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive her as such, there is no offense.
if a nun has someone else give her own food, but she does not give it herself;
if a nun gives someone else’s food, but she does not get anyone to give it;
if a nun gets someone to give what has not yet been given;
if a nun gets someone to give to someone who has not yet received anything;

The training rule on supporting a schism
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time Devadatta was pursuing schism in the Sangha, a break in transmission.
The monks were saying,
“Devadatta speaks contrary to the Teaching and the training.
How can he pursue schism in the Sangha?”
But Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta said to those monks,
“No, Venerables,
Devadatta does speak in accordance with the Teaching and the training.
And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we approve of this.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can these monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha?”
They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… Monks, how can those foolish men support Devadatta’s pursuit of schism in the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘That monk may have one, two, or three monks who side with him and support him, and they may say,
“Venerables, don’t correct this monk.
He speaks in accordance with the Teaching and the training.
And he speaks with our consent and acceptance. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we approve of this.”
The monks should correct those monks,
“No, Venerables,
this monk speaks contrary to the Teaching and the training.
Don’t consent to schism in the Sangha.
Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.”
If those monks still continue as before, the monks should press them up to three times to make them stop.
If they then stop, all is well.
If they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension.’”
that monk who is pursuing schism in the Sangha.
May have monks:
may have other monks.
Who side with him:
they have the same view, the same belief, the same persuasion as he does.
Who support him:
they praise him and take his side.
One, two, or three:
There is one, or two, or three.
They may say,
“Venerables, don’t correct this monk. He speaks in accordance with the Teaching and the training.
And he speaks with our consent and acceptance. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we approve of this.”
Those monks:
those monks who side with him.
The monks:
Other monks, those who see it or hear about it.
They should correct them like this:
“No, Venerables,
this monk speaks contrary to the Teaching and the training.
Don’t consent to schism in the Sangha.
Stay with the Sangha,
for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.”
And they should correct them a second
and a third time.
If they stop, all is well.
If they do not stop, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If those who hear about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Those monks, even if they have to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this:
“No, Venerables,
this monk speaks contrary to the Teaching and the training.
Don’t consent to schism in the Sangha.
Stay with the Sangha,
for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.”
They should correct them a second
and a third time.
If they stop, all is well.
If they do not stop, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Should press them:
“And, monks, they should be pressed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monks so-and-so and so-and-so are siding with him and supporting monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the Sangha.
They are not stopping that activity.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press them to make them stop.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monks so-and-so and so-and-so are siding with and supporting monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the Sangha.
They are not stopping that activity.
The Sangha presses them to make them stop.
Any monk who approves of pressing them to make them stop should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time …
For the third time I speak on this matter:
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monks so-and-so and so-and-so are siding with and supporting monk so-and-so who is pursuing schism in the Sangha.
They are not stopping that activity.
The Sangha presses them to make them stop.
Any monk who approves of pressing them to make them stop should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has pressed monks so-and-so and so-and-so to stop that activity.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’”
After the motion, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, they commit a serious offense.
When the last announcement is finished, they commit an offense entailing suspension.
For those who commit the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled.
Two or three may be pressed together, but not more than that.
They commit an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and they perceive it as such, but they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but they are unsure of it, and they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but they perceive it as illegitimate, and they do not stop, they commit an offense entailing suspension.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but they perceive it as legitimate, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but they are unsure of it, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and they perceive it as such, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
if they have not been pressed;
if they stop;
if they are insane;
if they are deranged;
if they are overwhelmed by pain;
if they are the first offenders.

“Let’s give the he-goat the name Dabba the Mallian
and the she-goat the name Mettiya the nun.
We can then say,
‘Earlier we spoke because of what we had heard about Dabba,
but now we’ve seen him ourselves copulating with the nun Mettiya.’”
They gave them those names
and then told the monks,
“Earlier we spoke about what we had heard,
but now we’ve seen Dabba copulating with the nun Mettiya.”
The monks replied,
“Don’t say such a thing.
Venerable Dabba wouldn’t do that.”
The monks told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba:
“Dabba, do you remember doing as these monks say?”
“Venerable Sir, you know about me.”
and a third time the Buddha asked
the same question
and got the same response.
He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers.
If it was done by you, say so;
if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.”
“Sir, since I was born I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake.”
“Well then, monks, call those monks to account,”
and he got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
The monks then questioned Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, who told them what had happened.
The monks said,
“Did you charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can Mettiya and Bhūmajaka charge Venerable Dabba like this?”
They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you charged Dabba the Mallian with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you charge Dabba like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk who is angry and displeased, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext, charges a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life,
and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is unrelated and used as a pretext, and he admits to his ill will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.

because of that upset, that ill will, that dissatisfaction, and that discontent, he is displeased.
An unrelated legal issue:
It is either unrelated in regard to offenses or unrelated in regard to legal issues.
How is a legal issue unrelated to a legal issue?
A legal issue arising from a dispute is unrelated to a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, and a legal issue arising from business.
A legal issue arising from an accusation is unrelated to a legal issue arising from an offense, a legal issue arising from business, and a legal issue arising from a dispute.
A legal issue arising from an offense is unrelated to a legal issue arising from business, a legal issue arising from a dispute, and a legal issue arising from an accusation.

An offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality.
An offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse.
An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing.
An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being.

Using as a pretext:
A pretext: there are ten pretexts—the pretext of caste, the pretext of name, the pretext of family, the pretext of characteristic, the pretext of offense, the pretext of almsbowl, the pretext of robe, the pretext of preceptor, the pretext of teacher, the pretext of dwelling.

A monk sees a worker
committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses another worker, saying,

he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of family:
a monk sees someone whose family name is Gotama …
Moggallāna …

Vāsiṭṭha committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses another person called Vāsiṭṭha, saying,

You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion. …”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of characteristic:
a monk sees someone tall …
dark-skinned …
light-skinned committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses another light-skinned person, saying,
“I’ve seen a light-skinned person.
You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion. …”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of offense:
a monk sees someone committing a light offense.
If he then accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, saying,
“You’re no longer an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan …”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of almsbowl:
a monk sees someone carrying a iron bowl …
a black clay bowl …
an ordinary clay bowl committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses another person carrying an ordinary clay bowl, saying,
“I’ve seen someone carrying an ordinary clay bowl.
You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion. …”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of robe:
a monk sees a rag-robe wearer …
wearing robes given by householders committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses another person wearing robes given by householders, saying,
“I’ve seen someone wearing robes given by householders.

he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of preceptor:
a monk sees a student of so-and-so committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses another student of that person, saying,
“I’ve seen a student of so-and-so.
You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion. …”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of teacher:
a monk sees a pupil of so-and-so committing an offense entailing expulsion.

You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion. …”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The pretext of dwelling:
a monk sees one who dwells in such-and-such a dwelling committing an offense entailing expulsion.
If he then accuses someone else who dwells in that dwelling, saying,
“I’ve seen one who dwells in such-and-such a dwelling.
You’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion.
You’re no longer an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan;
you’re excluded from the observance-day procedure, from the invitation procedure, from legal procedures of the Sangha,”
he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
With an offense entailing expulsion:
with one of the four.
accuses or causes to be accused.
To make him leave the monastic life:
to make him leave the monkhood, leave the state of an ascetic, leave his morality, leave the virtue of asceticism.
And then after some time:
the moment, the instant, the second after he has laid the charge.
He is questioned:
he is questioned about the grounds of his charge.
he is not spoken to by anyone.
The legal issue:
there are four kinds of legal issues: legal issues arising from disputes, legal issues arising from accusations, legal issues arising from offenses, legal issues arising from business.
Used as a pretext:
he has used a certain pretext among those listed above.
And he admits to his ill will:
“what I said was empty, what I said was false, what I said was unreal; I said it without knowing.”
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
A monk sees a second monk committing an offense entailing suspension, and the first monk regards it as an offense entailing suspension.
If he then accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, saying,
“You’re no longer an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan;
you’re excluded from the observance-day procedure, from the invitation procedure, from legal procedures of the Sangha,”
thus using an unrelated offense as a pretext, he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
A monk sees a second monk committing an offense entailing suspension, but the first monk regards it as a serious offense …
but the first monk regards it as an offense entailing confession …
but the first monk regards it as an offense entailing acknowledgment …
but the first monk regards it as an offense of wrong conduct …
but the first monk regards it as an offense of wrong speech.
If he then accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, saying,
“You’re no longer an ascetic …”
thus using an unrelated offense as a pretext, he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
A monk sees a second monk committing a serious offense, and the first monk regards it as a serious offense …
but the first monk regards it as a offense entailing confession …
but the first monk regards it as an offense entailing acknowledgment …
but the first monk regards it as an offense of wrong conduct …
but the first monk regards it as an offense of wrong speech …

If he then accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, saying,
“You’re no longer an ascetic …”
thus using an unrelated offense as a pretext, he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
A monk sees a second monk committing an offense entailing confession …
an offense entailing acknowledgment …
an offense of wrong speech, and the first monk regards it as an offense of wrong speech …

you’re excluded from the observance-day procedure, from the invitation procedure, from legal procedures of the Sangha,”
thus using an unrelated offense as a pretext, he commits an offense entailing suspension for each statement.
The permutation series is to be linked by doing the items one by one.
A monk sees a second monk committing an offense entailing suspension and the first monk regards it as an offense entailing suspension.
If he then has him accused of an offense entailing expulsion, saying,
“You’re no longer an ascetic …”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on satisfying one’s own desires
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.
One morning Udāyī robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of a beautiful widow, where he sat down on the prepared seat.
That woman approached Udāyī, bowed, and sat down.
Udāyī then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching.
And she said,
“Venerable, please say what you need.
I’m able to give robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines.”
“It’s not hard for us to get those requisites.
Give instead what’s hard for us to get.”
“What’s that, Venerable?”
“Sexual intercourse.”
“Is it wanted now?”
“It is, Sister.”
Saying, “Come,”
she entered her bedroom, took off her wrap, and lay back on the bed.
Udāyī approached her and spat out,
“Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch!”
and he left.
That woman then complained and criticized him,
“These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars.
They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character.
But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin;
they’ve lost the plot.
How can the ascetic Udāyī request sexual intercourse from me, but then spit out, ‘Who would touch this foul-smelling wretch!’ and depart?
What’s bad about me? How am I foul-smelling?
In what way am I inferior to whom?”
Other women, too, criticized him
in the same way,
The monks heard the criticism of those women,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī commend the satisfaction of his own desires in the presence of a woman?”
Those monks rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha.
The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you commended the satisfaction of your own desires in the presence of a woman?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you commend the satisfaction of your own desires in the presence of a woman?
Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion …
for the stilling of the fevers of sensual desire?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, encourages a woman to satisfy his own desires: “Sister, she provides the highest service who in this way satisfies one like me, who is virtuous, celibate, and of good character,” and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Overcome by lust:
having lust, longing for, in love with.
Distorted:
A desiring mind is distorted; an angry mind is distorted; a deluded mind is distorted.
But in this case “distorted” refers to the desiring mind.
a human female, not a female spirit, not a female ghost, not a female animal.
She understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech, what is decent and what is indecent.
near a woman, close to a woman.
His own desires:
his own sensual desires, for the sake of himself, aiming at himself, satisfying himself.
The highest:
this is the highest, this is the best, this is the foremost, this is the utmost, this is the most excellent.
a female aristocrat, a female brahmin, a female merchant, or a female worker.
a male aristocrat, a male brahmin, a male merchant, or a male worker.
Who is virtuous:
one who refrains from killing living beings, who refrains from stealing, who refrains from lying.
one who refrains from sexual intercourse.
Of good character:
he is one of good character because of that virtue and because of being celibate.
In this way:
with sexual intercourse.
Satisfies:
gives pleasure to.
If it is a reference to sexual intercourse:
if it is a reference to the sexual act.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
It is a woman, he perceives her as a woman, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages the woman to satisfy his own desires, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
It is a woman, but he is unsure of it …
It is a woman, but he perceives her as a _paṇḍaka_ …
It is a woman, but he perceives her as a man …
It is a woman, but he perceives her as an animal, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages the woman to satisfy his own desires, he commits a serious offense.
It is a _paṇḍaka_, he perceives him as a _paṇḍaka_, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages the _paṇḍaka_ to satisfy his own desires, he commits a serious offense.
It is a _paṇḍaka_, but he is unsure of it …
It is a _paṇḍaka_, but he perceives him as a man …
It is a _paṇḍaka_, but he perceives him as an animal …
It is a _paṇḍaka_, but he perceives him as a woman, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages the _paṇḍaka_ to satisfy his own desires, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
It is a man …
It is an animal, he perceives it as an animal …
It is an animal, but he perceives it as a woman …
It is an animal, but he perceives it as a _paṇḍaka_ …
It is an animal, but he perceives it as a man, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages the animal to satisfy his own desires, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
It is two women, he perceives them both as women, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages both women to satisfy his own desires, he commits two offenses entailing suspension.
It is a woman and a _paṇḍaka_, he perceives both as women, and he has lust.
If the monk encourages both of them to satisfy his own desires, he commits one offense entailing suspension and one offense of wrong conduct.
if he says, “Support us with robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines;”
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on emission of semen
Venerables, these thirteen rules on suspension come up for recitation.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was dissatisfied with the spiritual life,
and he became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs.
Venerable Udāyī saw him in this condition and said to him,
“Seyyasaka, you’re not looking well.
Are you perhaps dissatisfied with the spiritual life?”
“Well then, eat as much as you like, sleep as much as you like, and bathe as much as you like.
And whenever you become discontent and sensual desire overwhelms you, emit semen with your hand.”
“But is that allowable?”
“Yes, I do it too.”
Then Seyyasaka ate, slept, and bathed as much as he liked,
and whenever he became discontent and sensual desire overwhelmed him, he emitted semen with his hand.
After some time Seyyasaka became satisfied, and he had a good color, with a bright face and clear skin.
Monks who were his friends said to him,
“Seyyasaka, you used to be thin, haggard, and pale, your veins protruding all over your limbs.
But now you’re satisfied, and you have a good color, with a bright face and clear skin.
Have you been taking medicine?”
“No, I haven’t.
I just eat, sleep, and bathe as much as I like,
and whenever I become discontent and sensual desire overwhelms me, I emit semen with my hand.”
“Do you eat the food given in faith with the same hand you use to emit semen?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Seyyasaka emit semen with his hand?”
They rebuked Seyyasaka in many ways and then told the Buddha.
The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned Seyyasaka:
“Is it true, Seyyasaka, that you emit semen with your hand?”
“Yes, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you emit semen with your hand?
Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion;
for freedom from bondage, not for the sake of bondage;
for the sake of non-grasping, not for the sake of grasping?
When I’ve taught like this, how can you be intent on passion, bondage, and grasping?
Haven’t I given many teachings for the fading away of sensual desire, for the clearing away of intoxication, for the removal of thirst, for the uprooting of attachment, for the cutting off of the round of birth and death, for the stopping of craving, for fading away, for ending, for extinguishment?
Haven’t I given many teachings the abandoning of worldly pleasures, the full understanding of the perceptions of worldly pleasure, the removal of thirst for worldly pleasures, the elimination of thoughts of worldly pleasures, the stilling of the fever of worldly pleasures?
Foolish man, This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it,
but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”
Then, after rebuking Seyyasaka in many ways for being difficult to support …
the Buddha said, “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘Intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
At one time monks ate fine foods, fell asleep without mindfulness and clear awareness,
and emitted semen while dreaming.
They became anxious, thinking,
“The Buddha has laid down a training rule
that intentional emission of semen is an offense entailing suspension.
We had an emission of semen while dreaming,
and that involves intention.
Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing suspension?”
They told the Buddha.
“Monks, there’s intention involved,
but it’s negligible.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, is an offense entailing suspension.’”
Intentional:
knowing, perceiving, having intended, having decided, he transgresses.
there are ten kinds of semen:
blue, yellow, red, white, the color of buttermilk, the color of water, the color of oil, the color of milk, the color of curd, the color of ghee.
making it move from its base—this is what is meant by “emission”.
Except while dreaming:
apart from that which occurs while dreaming.
An offense entailing suspension:
only the Sangha gives probation for that offense, sends back to the beginning, gives the trial period, and rehabilitates—not several monks, not an individual.
Therefore it is called “an offense entailing suspension.
This is the name and designation of this class of offense.
Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
One emits with one’s own body;

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on corrupters of families
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Assaji and Punabbasuka were the resident monks at Kīṭāgiri. They were bad and shameless,
and they were misbehaving in this way:
They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together.
They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides.
They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same.
They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughter-in-laws, and the female slaves of good families.
They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels.
They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, and both on the same sheets and under the same covers.
They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics.
They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed.
While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, so would they.
They played various games: board games with eight and ten rows, imaginary board games, hopscotch, spillikins, dice games, tip-cat, painting-with-the-hand games, ball games, toy-pipe games, toy-plow games, turning somersaults, toy-windmill games, toy-measure games, toy-carriage games, toy-bow games, letter-guessing games, thought-guessing games, games of mimicking deformities.
They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, in swordsmanship.
And they ran in front of elephants, horses, and carriages, and they ran backwards and forwards.
They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed.
They spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls, “Dance here, Sister,” and they made gestures of approval. And they misbehaved in a variety of ways.
Just then a certain monk who had completed the rainy-season residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at Kīṭāgiri.
In the morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood.
He was pleasing in the way he entered and returned, in looking at and in looking away, in drawing in and stretching out his arms; his eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment.
When people saw him, they said, “Who is this, acting like a fool, like a dullard, continuously frowning?
Who will give almsfood to him?
Almsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka, for they are gentle, congenial, pleasant to speak with, greeting one with a smile, welcoming, friendly, open, the first to speak.”
A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in Kīṭāgiri.
He approached him, bowed, and said, “Venerable, have you received any almsfood?”
“No, I haven’t.”
“Come, let’s go to my house.”
He took that monk to his house and gave him a meal.
“Where are you going, Venerable?”
“I’m going to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.”
“Well then, would you please pay respect at the Buddha’s feet in my name and say,
‘Venerable Sir, the monastery at Kīṭāgiri has been corrupted.
Assaji and Punabbasuka are the resident monks there. They are bad and shameless,
and they are misbehaving in a variety of ways:
They plant flowering trees, water them … And they are misbehaving in a variety of ways.
Those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it,
and there is no longer any support for the Sangha.
The good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on.
Sir, please send monks to stay at the monastery at Kīṭāgiri.’”
The monk consented, got up, and left for Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, he went to the Buddha in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to him,
“I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.
And where have you come from?”
“I’m keeping well, Sir, I’m comfortable;
I’m not tired from traveling.”
He then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiri,
adding, “That’s where I’ve come from, Sir.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving like this at Kīṭāgiri?
And is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it,
that there is no longer any support for the Sangha,
and that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“Monks, how can those foolish men misbehave like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
… After criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna:
“Sāriputta, the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from Kīṭāgiri.
They are your students.”
“Sir, how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri?
They are temperamental and harsh.”
“Well, take many monks.”
“And, monks, this is how it should be done.
First you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka.
They should then be reminded of what they have done, before they are charged with an offense.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behaved.
Their bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by them have been seen and heard about.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are corrupters of families and badly behaved.
Their bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by them have been seen and heard about.
The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri.
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time …
For the third time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. … should speak up.
The Sangha has performed the legal procedure of banishing them, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Soon afterwards a sangha of monks headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to Kīṭāgiri and did the procedure of banishing those monks, prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri.
After the Sangha had done the procedure, those monks did not conduct themselves properly or suitably so as to deserve to be released, nor did they ask the monks for forgiveness. Instead they abused and reviled them, and they slandered them as acting from desire, ill will, confusion, and fear. And they left and they disrobed.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“When the Sangha has done a legal procedure of banishing them, how can these monks act like this?”
They rebuked the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that when the Sangha had done a procedure of banishing them, the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka didn’t act properly … and they disrobed?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk who lives supported by a village or town is a corrupter of families and badly behaved, and his bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by him have been seen and heard about,
then the monks should correct him like this:
“Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved.
Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about.
Leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.”
If he replies,
“You’re acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear; because of this sort of offense, you banish some, but not others,”
the monks should correct him like this:
“No, Venerable, the monks are not acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.
Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved.
Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about.
Leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.”
If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop.
If he then stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
A monk … a village or town:
a village and a town and a city are included in just a village and a town.
Lives supported by:
robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines can be obtained in that place.
there are four kinds of family: the aristocratic family, the brahmin family, the merchant family, the worker family.
A corrupter of families:
he corrupts families by means of flowers, fruit, bath powder, soap, toothbrushes, bamboo, medical treatment, or by taking messages on foot.
Badly behaved:
he plants flowering trees and has it done; he waters them and has it done; he plucks them and has it done; he ties the flowers together and has it done.
Has been seen and heard about:
those who are present see it; those who are absent hear about it.
The families corrupted by him:
they have lost their faith because of him; they have lost their confidence because of him.
Have been seen and heard about:
those who are present see it; those who are absent hear about it.
that monk who is a corrupter of families.
The monks:
Other monks, those who see it or hear about it.
They should correct him like this:
“Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved.
Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about.
Leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.”
If he replies, “You’re acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear; because of this sort of offense, you banish some, but not others.”
that monk who is having a legal procedure done against him.
The monks:
Other monks, those who see it or hear about it.
They should correct him like this:
“No, Venerable, the monks are not acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.
Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved.
Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about.
Leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.”
And they should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If those who hear about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
That monk, even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this:
“No, Venerable, the monks are not acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.
Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved.
Your bad behavior has been seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you have been seen and heard about.
Leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.”
They should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Should press him:
“And, monks, he should be pressed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so, who has had a legal procedure of banishment done against himself, is slandering the monks as acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.
And he keeps on doing it.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press him to make him stop.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so, who has had a legal procedure of banishment done against himself, is slandering the monks as acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.
And he keeps on doing it.
The Sangha presses him to make him stop.
Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter …
For the third time I speak on this matter …
The Sangha has pressed monk so-and-so to stop.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, he commits a serious offense.
When the last announcement is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
For one who commits the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
only the Sangha gives probation for that offense, sends back to the beginning, gives the trial period, and rehabilitates—not several monks, not an individual.
Therefore it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
This is the name and designation of this class of offense.
Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, but he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as illegitimate, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as legitimate, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if he has not been pressed;
if he stops;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The thirteenth rule, the training rule on corrupters of families, is finished.
“Venerables, the thirteen rules on suspension have been recited, nine being immediate offenses, four after the third announcement.
If a monk commits any one of them, he is to undergo probation for the same number of days as he knowingly concealed that offense.
When this is completed, he must undertake the trial period for a further six days.
When this is completed, he is to be rehabilitated wherever there is an Sangha of at least twenty monks.
If that monk is rehabilitated by an Sangha of even one less than twenty, that monk is not rehabilitated and those monks are at fault. This is the proper procedure.
In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’
A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’
A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’
You are pure in this and therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.”
The group of thirteen is finished.
“This is the summary:
Emission, physical contact,
Indecent, and his own needs;
Matchmaking, and a hut,
And a dwelling, groundless.
A pretext, and schism,
Those who side with him;
Difficult to correct, and corrupters of families:
The thirteen offenses entailing suspension.”

The training rule on schism in the Sangha
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta, and he said to them,
“Come, let’s create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama, a break in transmission.”
Kokālika said to Devadatta,
“The ascetic Gotama has great supernormal powers.
How can we do this?”
“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things:
‘Sir, in many ways the Buddha praises fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic.
And there are five things that lead to just that.
It would be good, Sir:
If the monks stayed in the wilderness for life,
and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense;
If they ate only almsfood for life,
and whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offense;
If they were rag-robe wearers for life,
and whoever accepts a robe from a householder would commit an offense;
If they live at the foot of a tree for life,
and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense;
If they didn’t eat fish or meat for life,
and whoever does would commit an offense.’
The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this.
We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.”
Kokālika said, “It might be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five points,
for people have confidence in austerity.”
Devadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down,
and Devadatta made his request.
The Buddha replied, “No, Devadatta.
Those who wish may stay in the wilderness, and those who wish may live near inhabited areas.
Those who wish may eat only almsfood, and those who wish may accept invitational meals.
Those who wish may be rag-robe wearers, and those who wish may accept robes from householders.
I have allowed a resting place at the foot of a tree for eight months of the year, as well as fish and meat which are pure in three respects:
one hasn’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.”
Devadatta thought,
“The Buddha doesn’t allow the five points,” and he was glad and elated. He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left with his followers.
Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points,
saying, “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them,
but we practice in accordance with them.”
The foolish people with little faith and confidence said,
“These Sakyan ascetics are practicing asceticism and they live for the sake of erasing defilements.
But the acetic Gotama lives in luxury and has chosen to live in abundance.”
But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta,
“How can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the Buddha?”
The monks heard the criticism of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him
in the same way.
After rebuking Devadatta in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta:
“Is it true, Devadatta, that you are pursuing schism in the Sangha, a break in transmission?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you pursue schism in the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk pursues schism in a united Sangha or persists in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism, the monks should correct him,
“Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism.
Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.”
If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop.
If he then stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
A united Sangha:
those belonging to the same Buddhist sect and staying within the same monastic boundary.
Pursues schism:
thinking, “What can be done so that these become various, separated, divided,” he searches for a faction and puts together a group.
A legal issue conducive to schism:
the eighteen bases for schism.
If he persists in:
if he does not stop.
the monk who is pursuing schism in the Sangha.
The monks:
Other monks, those who see it or hear it.
They should correct him like this:
“Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism.
Stay with the Sangha,
for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.”
And they should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If those who heard about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
That monk, even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this:
“Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism.
Stay with the Sangha,
for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.”
They should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Should press him:
“And, monks, he should be pressed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so is pursuing schism in the united Sangha.
He is not stopping that activity.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press him to make him stop.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so is pursuing schism in the united Sangha.
He is not stopping that activity.
The Sangha presses him to make him stop.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.
At this time, when Udāyī saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband, he would praise the young woman in the presence of the parents of the young man,
“The young woman of such-and such a family is beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent.
She is suitable for your son.”
They would reply,
“Venerable, they don’t know who we are.
If you would persuade them to give the girl, we would take her for our son.”
And he praised the young man in the presence of the parents of the young woman,
“The young man of such-and-such a family is handsome, intelligent, skilled, and diligent.
He is suitable for your daughter.”
They would reply,
“Venerable, they don’t know who we are,
and we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girl.
But if you would persuade them to ask us, we would give our girl to the young man.”
In this way he arranged for the taking of a bride, for the giving of a bride, and for marriage.
At that time there was a certain former courtesan who had a beautiful daughter.
On one occasion some lay followers of the Ājīvaka religion came from another village and said to that courtesan,
“Lady, please give your girl to our boy.”
“Sirs, I don’t know who you are.
And I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.”
Some people asked those Ājīvaka lay followers
why they had come,
and they replied, “We came to ask that courtesan to give her daughter to our son,
but she has refused.”
“But why did you ask the courtesan?
You should speak to Venerable Udāyī.
He’ll persuade her.”
They then approached Udāyī and said,
“Venerable, we’ve asked that courtesan here to give her daughter to our son,
but she has refused.
Would you please persuade her to give us her daughter?”
Udāyī agreed. Soon afterwards he went to that courtesan and said,
“Why didn’t you give them your daughter?”
“I don’t know who they are, Sir,
and I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.”
“I know them.
Please give her to them.”
“If you know them, I’ll give her away.”
She then gave her daughter to those Ājīvaka followers,
and they took her away. For a month they treated her like a daughter-in-law,
but after that like a slave.
The girl sent a message to her mother:
“Mum, I’m unhappy and miserable.
For a month they treated me like a daughter-in-law,
but after that like a slave.
Come, mum, and take me home.”
Soon afterwards the courtesan went to those Ājīvakas and said,
“Please don’t treat my girl like a slave;
treat her like a daughter-in-law!”
They replied,
“We deal with the ascetic, not with you.
We don’t want to know you.”
Being dismissed, she returned to Sāvatthī.
A second time the girl sent the same message to her mother.
That courtesan then approached Udāyī and said,
“Venerable, my girl is unhappy and miserable.
They treated her like a daughter-in-law for a month,
but then like a slave.
Please tell them
to treat her like a daughter-in-law.”
And Udāyī went to the Ājīvakas and said,
“Please don’t treat this girl like a slave;
treat her like a daughter-in-law.”
They replied,
“We deal with the courtesan, not with you.
An ascetic shouldn’t get involved;
you should behave like a good ascetic.
We don’t want to know you.”
Being dismissed, he returned to Sāvatthī.
A third time that girl sent the same message to her mother,
and a second time the courtesan approached Udāyī and told him the same thing.
He replied, “When I went the first time, they just dismissed me.
Please go yourself.
I’m not going.”
Then that courtesan complained and criticized him,
“May Venerable Udāyī be miserable and unhappy, just as my girl is miserable and unhappy because of her nasty mother-in-law, nasty father-in-law, and nasty husband.”
And the girl, too, complained and criticized him in the same way,
as did other women who were unhappy with their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, and their husbands.
But those women who were happy with their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, and their husbands wished him well,
“May Venerable Udāyī be happy and well, just as we are happy and well because of our good mothers-in-law, good fathers-in-law, and good husbands.”
The monks heard that some women were criticizing him whereas others were wishing him well.
And the monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker?”
They told the Buddha.
The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you acted as a matchmaker?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you act as a matchmaker?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk acts as a matchmaker, conveying a man’s intentions to a woman or a woman’s intentions to a man, for marriage or for an affair, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a number of scoundrels who were enjoying themselves in a park sent a messenger to a prostitute:
“Please come; let’s enjoy ourselves in the park.”
She replied,
“Sirs, I don’t know who you are.
I am wealthy already, and I don’t want to go outside the city.”
The messenger returned the message.
A certain man then said to those men,
“Why did you ask the prostitute?
You should’ve spoken to Venerable Udāyī.
He’ll persuade her.”
But a certain Buddhist lay follower said,
That’s not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics.
Venerable Udāyī won’t do it.”
And they made a bet on whether he would.
Those scoundrels approached Udāyī and said,
“Venerable, while we were enjoying ourselves in the park, we sent a message to such-and-such a prostitute,
asking her to come,
but she refused.
Would you please persuade her?”
Udāyī agreed. And he went to that prostitute and said,
“Why don’t you go to those men?”
“I don’t know them, Venerable.”
“I know them.
Please go.”
“If you know them, Sir, I’ll go.”
And those men took her to the park.
Then that lay follower complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”
The monks heard it,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”
They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you acted as a matchmaker for a brief affair?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk acts as a matchmaker, conveying a man’s intentions to a woman or a woman’s intentions to a man, for marriage or for an affair, even if just a brief one, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Acts as a matchmaker, conveying:
sent by a woman he goes to a man, or sent by a man he goes to a woman.
A man’s intentions to a woman:
he informs a woman of a man’s intention.
A woman’s intentions to a man:
he informs a man of a woman’s intention.
For marriage:
you will be his wife.
For an affair:
you will be his mistress.
Even if just a brief one:
you will be in a short relationship.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.

The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on indecent speech
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness,
in a beautiful dwelling.
On one occasion a number of women came to the monastery to see the dwellings.
They approached Udāyī
“Venerable, we would like to see your dwelling.”
Then, after showing them his own dwelling, he praised and disparaged their private parts; he requested and implored, asked and enquired, described, instructed, and abused.
Those women among them who were shameless scoundrels flirted with Udāyī; they called out to him, laughed with him, and teased him.
But, after leaving, those among them who had a sense of shame complained to the monks,
“Venerables, this isn’t suitable and appropriate.
We wouldn’t want to hear this from our own husbands, let alone from Venerable Udāyī.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī speak indecently to women?”
They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and told the Buddha.
The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you spoke indecently to women?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it should not to be done.
How can you speak indecently to women?
Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion …
for the stilling of the fevers of sense desire?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, speaks indecent words connected with sexual intercourse to a woman, as a young man might to a young woman, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Overcome by lust:
having lust, longing for, in love with.
Distorted:
A desiring mind is distorted; an angry mind is distorted; a deluded mind is distorted.
But in this case “distorted” refers to the desiring mind.
a human female, not a female spirit, not a female ghost, not a female animal.
She understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech, what is decent and what is indecent.
Indecent words:
speech connected with the anus, the vagina, or sexual intercourse.
misconduct is what is meant.
As a young man might to a young woman:
a male youth to a female youth, a boy to a girl, a male who indulges in worldly pleasures to a female who indulges in worldly pleasures.
Connected with sexual intercourse:
connected with the sexual act.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
Referring to the anus or the vagina, he praises, disparages, requests, implores, asks, enquires, describes, instructs, abuses.
extols, praises, commends the two private orifices.
Disparages:
despises, reviles, censures the the anus or the vagina.

“When will you please your father?”
“When will you please the gods?”

“When will I have sexual intercourse with you?”
saying, “How do you give to your husband?”
“How do you give to your lover?”
saying, “So you give to your husband like this,
and to your lover like this?”
Describes:
having been asked, he says, “Give like this.
When you do, you’ll be dear and pleasing to your husband.”
Instructs:
not having been asked, he says, “Give like this.
When you do, you’ll be dear and pleasing to your husband.”

The training rule on being difficult to correct
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Channa was misbehaving.
The monks would tell him,
“Don’t do that;
it’s not allowable,”
and he would reply,
“Who are you to correct me?
I should correct you!
The Buddha is mine; the Teaching is mine.
The Master realized the Truth because of me.
Just as a great wind lifts up grass, sticks, and fallen leaves all at once, just as a mountain stream lifts up the leaves of various water plants all at once,
so too you–having various names, various families, various castes, various clans–having gone forth, have been lifted up together.
So, who are you to correct me?
I should correct you!
The Buddha is mine; the Teaching is mine.
The Master realized the Truth because of me.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Channa make himself incorrigible when he’s legitimately corrected by the monks?”
They rebuked Venerable Channa in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa:
“Is it true, Channa, that you make yourself incorrigible when you’re legitimately corrected by the monks?
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk is difficult to correct, and he makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks concerning the training rules that are recited, saying,
“Venerables, don’t say anything to me, either good or bad, and I won’t say anything to you, either good or bad;
please refrain from correcting me,”
then the monks should correct him like this:
“Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible.
And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you.
For it’s in this way that the Buddha’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction and mutual clearing of offenses.”
If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop.
If he then stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
If a monk is difficult to correct:
if he is difficult to correct, endowed with qualities that make him hard to correct, resistant, not receiving instructions respectfully.
Concerning the training rules that are recited:
concerning the training rules of the Monastic Code.
The monks:
other monks.
Legitimately:
about whatever training rule has been laid down by the Buddha—this is called “legitimately”.
When he is corrected concerning that, he makes himself incorrigible, saying,
“Venerables, don’t say anything to me, either good or bad, and I won’t say anything to you, either good or bad; please refrain from correcting me.”
the monk who is difficult to correct.
The monks:
Other monks, those who see it or hear about it.
They should correct him like this:
“Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible.
And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you.
For it’s in this way that the Buddha’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction and mutual clearing of offenses.”
And they should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If those who hear about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
That monk, even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this:
“Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible. And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you. For it’s in this way that the Buddha’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction
and mutual clearing of offenses.”
They should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he stops, all is well.
If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Should press him:
“And, monks, he should be pressed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks.
He keeps on doing it.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press him to make him stop.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks.
He keeps on doing it.
The Sangha presses him to make him stop.
Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time …
For the third time I speak on this matter:
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks.
He keeps on doing it.
The Sangha presses him to make him stop.
Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has pressed monk so-and-so to stop.

I will remember it thus.’”
After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, he commits a serious offense.
When the last announcement is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
For one who commits the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, but he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.

The training rule on building huts
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging. The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner, and were inappropriate in size.
Moreover, they were never finished,
and so the monks kept on asking and begging,
“Give a man, give a servant, give an ox, give a cart, give a machete, give a hatchet, give an ax, give a spade, give a chisel, give a creeper, give bamboo, give reed, give grass, give clay.”
People felt oppressed by all the asking and begging, so much so that when they saw a monk they became alarmed and fearful, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors.
They even ran away when they saw cows, thinking they were monks.
Just then Venerable Mahākassapa, after completing the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha, set out for Āḷavī.
When he eventually arrived in Āḷavī,
he stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine.
In the morning Venerable Mahākassapa robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Āḷavī for alms.
When people saw him they became fearful and alarmed, and they ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors.
After finishing his almsround and eating his meal, Venerable Mahākassapa returned and said to the monks:
“Āḷavī used to have plenty of food, and it wasn’t difficult to get by on almsfood.
But now Āḷavī is short of almsfood, and it’s not easy to get by on alms.
Why is that?”
The monks told Venerable Mahākassapa what had happened.
Soon afterwards, after staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha too set out wandering toward Āḷavī.
When he eventually arrived at Āḷavī,
he too stayed at the Aggāḷava Shrine.
Venerable Mahākassapa approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told the Buddha what had happened.
The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks of Āḷavī:
“Is it true, monks, that you’re building huts through begging, huts intended for yourself, without a sponsoring owner, and inappropriate in size?
And that because they were never completed,
you kept on asking and begging
for all sorts of things,
and people felt oppressed to the point where they now avoid monks?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Once upon a time, monks, two sages who were brothers lived near the river Ganges.
On one occasion the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage. He encircled him with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head.
Because of his fear of that dragon, the younger sage became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs.
The older sage saw him like this
and asked him what was the matter.
And the younger sage told him.
The elder sage said, ‘Would you like that dragon not to return?’
‘I would.’
‘Well then, did you see anything belonging to that dragon?’
‘I saw an ornamental gem on his neck.’
‘In that case ask the dragon for that gem.’
Soon the dragon king again emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage.
And the sage said to him,
‘Sir, give me the gem;
I want the gem.’
And the dragon thought,
‘The monk is asking for the gem,’ and he quickly left.
Once more the dragon king emerged from the Ganges and approached the younger sage.
The sage saw him coming
and said to him,
‘Sir, give me the gem;
I want the gem.’
When the dragon heard him,
he turned around right there.
Yet again the dragon king emerged from the Ganges.
The younger sage saw him emerging
and said to him,
‘Sir, give me the gem;
I want the gem.’
The dragon king then spoke these verses to the sage:
‘My food and drink are abundant and sublime,
And they appear because of this gem.
I won’t give it to you—you ask too much,
Nor will I return to your hermitage.
Like a youth holding a clean stone,
You frighten me, asking for this gem.
I won’t give it to you—you ask too much,
Nor will I return to your hermitage.’
And the dragon king Maṇikaṇṭha thought,
‘The monk is asking for the gem; he wants the gem,’
and he left and never returned.
Because he did not get to see that beautiful dragon, the young sage became even thinner, more haggard and pale, his veins protruding even more.
The older sage saw him like this
and asked what was the matter.
He replied, ‘It’s because I no longer get to see that beautiful dragon.’
The older sage then spoke to him in verse:
‘One shouldn’t beg from those one wishes to be dear to;
One is detested for asking for too much.
When the brahmin asked the dragon for his gem,
It left and was never to be seen again.’
One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for asking and begging,
let alone by human beings.”
“At one time, monks, a certain monk lived in a forest grove on the slopes of the Himalayas.
Not far from that grove was a large, low-lying marsh.
A great flock of birds fed in the marsh during the day and entered the grove to roost at night.
The monk was disturbed by the noise of the flocking birds, and so he came to see me. He bowed, sat down,
and I said to him,
“I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.
And where have you come from?’
‘I’m keeping well, Sir, I’m comfortable.
And I’m not tired from traveling.
On the slopes of the Himalayas there’s a great forest grove
and close by a large low-lying marsh.
A large flock of birds feeds in that low-lying marsh during the day and comes at night to roost in that forest grove.
That’s where I’ve come from, Sir,
and I left because I was disturbed by the noise of that flock of birds.’
‘Would you like that flock of birds not to return?’
‘I would, Sir.’
‘Well then, go back to that forest grove. In the first part of the night, call out three times,
“Listen to me, good birds.
From whoever roosts in this forest grove, I want a feather.
Each one of you must give me a feather.”
And in the middle
and third part of the night do the same thing.’
The monk returned to that forest grove and did as instructed.
That flock of birds thought,
‘The monk is asking for a feather; he wants a feather,’
and they left that grove
and never returned.
One will be disliked even by animals, monks, for asking and begging,
let alone by human beings.”
“The father of Raṭṭhapāla, monks, once spoke to his son with this verse:
‘All these people, Raṭṭhāpāla,
Who come to me and beg—
I don’t even know them.
So why don’t you beg from me?’
‘The beggar isn’t liked,
Nor is one who doesn’t give when asked.
That’s why I do not beg from you;
Please don’t hate me for this.’
If Raṭṭhapāla, who came from a good family, could speak like this to his own father,
how much more, then, can people do so to each other.
It’s hard, monks, for householders to acquire and protect their possessions.
And still, foolish men, you kept on asking and begging
for all sorts of things.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, it is to be no more than twelve standard handspans long and seven wide inside.
He must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides.
If a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, or he exceeds the right size, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
By means of begging:
having himself begged for a man, a servant, an ox, a cart, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay.
plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.
building it himself or having someone else build it.
Without a sponsoring owner:
there is no other owner, either a woman or a man, either a lay person or one gone forth.
Intended for himself:
for his own use.
It is to be no more than twelve standard handspans long:
measured outside.
And seven wide inside:
measured inside.
He must get monks to approve a site:
The monk who wishes to build a hut should clear a site. He should then approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
“Venerables, I wish, by means of begging, to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
I request the Sangha to inspect the site for the hut.”
He should make his request a second
and a third time.
If the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site, they should all go.
If the whole Sangha is not able to inspect the site, then those monks there who are competent and capable—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, and who know what is meant by a space on all sides and a lack of space on all sides—should be asked and then appointed.
“And, monks, they should be appointed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen
Monk so-and-so, by means of begging, wishes to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for the hut.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen
Monk so-and-so, by means of begging, wishes to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for the hut.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the hut should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for a hut for monk so-and-so.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’
The appointed monks should go and inspect the site for the hut to find out if any harm will be done and if it has a space on all sides.
If harm will be done and it lacks a space on all sides, they should say, ‘Don’t build here.’
If no harm will be done and it has a space on all sides, they should inform the Sangha:
‘No harm will be done and it has a space on all sides.’
The monk who wishes to build the hut should then approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels with his palms together, and say:
‘Venerables, I wish, by means of begging, to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
I request the Sangha to approve the site for the hut.’
He should make his request a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so, by means of begging, wishes to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to approve the site for the hut.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should approve the site.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so, by means of begging, wishes to build a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to approve the site for the hut.
The Sangha approves the site for the hut of monk so-and-so.
Any monk who approves of approving the site for the hut should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has approved the site for a hut for monk so-and-so
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’”
Where harm will be done:
it is the abode of ants, termites, rats, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, elephants, horses, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, or hyenas, or any other animals;
or it is bordering on a field of grain, a field of vegetables, a slaughtering-place, a place of execution, a charnel ground, a park, a king’s property, an elephant-stable, a horse-stable, a prison, a bar, a slaughterhouse, a vehicle road, a crossroads, a public meeting hall, or a cul-de-sac—
this is called “where harm will be done”.
Which lacks a space on all sides:
it is not possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—this is called “which lacks a space on all sides”.
Where no harm will be done:
it is not the abode of ants, termites, rats, snakes, scorpions, centipedes … it is not bordering on … a cul-de-sac—this is called “where no harm will be done”.

it is possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—this is called “which has a space on all sides”.
By means of begging:
having himself begged for a man, a servant … clay.
plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.
building it himself or having someone else build it.
Or he does not get monks to approve the site, or he exceeds the right size:
if the site for the hut has not been approved through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements, or he builds a hut or has one built which exceeds the allowable length or breadth even by the width of a hair, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When one piece is left to complete the hut, he commits a serious offense.
When the last piece is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:

The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on building dwellings
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery.
At that time a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him,
“Venerable, please find a site for a dwelling, and I’ll have one built for you.”
While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom.
People complained and criticized him,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics have such a tree felled?
They are hurting life with one sense faculty.”
The monks heard the criticism of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized
Venerable Channa in the same manner.
After rebuking Venerable Channa in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa:
“Is it true, Channa, that you had a tree felled that had served as a shrine and that was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you do such a thing?
People perceive trees as living beings.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself,
he must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides.
If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
A large dwelling:
one with a sponsoring owner is what is meant.
plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.
building it himself or having someone else build it.
With a sponsoring owner:
there is another owner, either a woman or a man, either a lay person or one gone forth.
Intended for himself:
for his own use.
He must get monks to approve a site:
The monk who is building a dwelling should clear a site, then approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
“Venerables, I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
I request the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling.”
He should make his request a second
and a third time.
If the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site, they should all go.
If the whole Sangha is not able to inspect the site,
then those monks there who are competent and capable—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, and who understands the meaning of space on all sides and a lacks a space on all sides—should be asked and then appointed.
“And, monks, they should be appointed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling.
The Sangha is appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for a dwelling for monk so-and-so.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’
The appointed monks should go and inspect the site for the dwelling
to find out if any harm will be done and if it has a space on all sides.
If harm will be done and it lacks a space on all sides, they should say,
‘Don’t build here.’
If no harm will be done and it has a space on all sides, they should inform the Sangha:
‘No harm will be done and it has a space on all sides.’
The monk who is building the dwelling should then approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I wish to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself.
I request the Sangha to approve the site for the dwelling.’
He should make his request a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to approve the site for the dwelling.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should approve the site.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so wishes to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself.
He is requesting the Sangha to approve the site for the dwelling.
The Sangha approves the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so.
Any monk who agrees to approving the site for the dwelling should remain silent.
Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up.
The Sangha has approved the site for a dwelling for monk so-and-so.
The Sangha agrees and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’”
Where harm will be done:
it is the abode of ants, termites, rats, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, elephants, horses, lions, tigers, leopards, bears, or hyenas, or any other animals;
or it is bordering on a field of grain, a field of vegetables, a slaughtering-place, a place of execution, a charnel ground, a park, the king’s property, an elephant-stable, a horse-stable, a prison, a bar, a slaughterhouse, a vehicle road, a crossroads, a public meeting hall, or a cul-de-sac—
this is called “where harm will be done”.
Which lacks a space on all sides:
it is not possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—
this is called “which lacks a space on all sides”.
Where no harm will be done:
it is not the abode of ants …
it is not bordering on … a cul-de-sac—
this is called “where no harm will be done”.
Which has a space on all sides:
it is possible to go around it with a yoked cart, or to go all the way around it with a ladder—
this is called “which has a space on all sides”.
A large dwelling:
one with a sponsoring owner is what is meant.
plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside.
building it himself or having someone else build it.
Or he does not get monks to approve the site:
if the site has not been approved through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements, and he then builds a dwelling or has one built, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When one piece is left to complete the dwelling, he commits a serious offense.
When the last piece is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension.
He commits an offense entailing suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”.
If a monk builds a dwelling whose site has not been approved, where harm will be done, and which lacks a space on all sides, he commits one offense entailing suspension and two offenses of wrong conduct.
If a monk builds a dwelling whose site has not been approved, where harm will be done, but which has a space on all sides, he commits one offense entailing suspension and one offense of wrong conduct.

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on physical contact
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness.
He had a beautiful dwelling with a room in the middle and corridors on all sides.
The bed and bench were nicely made up,
and the water for drinking and the water for washing had been well placed.
The precincts were well swept.
Many people came to see Udāyī’s dwelling.
Among them was a certain brahmin and his wife. They approached Udāyī and said,
“Venerable, we would like to have look at your dwelling.”
“Well then, brahmin, have a look.”
Udāyī took the key, unlocked the upper bolt, opened the door, and entered the dwelling.
The brahmin entered after him
and then the brahmin lady.
Opening some windows and closing others, Udāyī walked around the inner room and came up from behind the brahmin lady, touching her all over.
Then the brahmin thanked Udāyī and left.
The brahmin then expressed his delight,
“These Sakyan ascetics who live in the wilderness are superb.
Venerable Udāyī is superb!”
But the brahmin lady said,
“What’s superb about him?
Just as you touch me all over, so did he.”
The brahmin then complained and criticized him,
“These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars.
They claim to live according to the Truth, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and of good character.
But they don’t have the qualities of an ascetic or a brahmin.
They’ve lost the plot.
How can the ascetic Udāyī touch my wife all over?
It’s not possible to go to a monastery or a monk’s dwelling with wives of respectable families, with daughters, girls, daughters-in-law, or female slaves of respectable families.
If you do, the Sakyan ascetics might molest them.”
The monks heard the criticism of that brahmin.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Udāyī,
“How can Venerable Udāyī make physical contact with a woman?”
They then told the Buddha.
The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you made physical contact with a woman?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you make physical contact with a woman?
Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion …
for the stilling of the fever for sense pleasures?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, makes physical contact with a woman—holding her hand or hair, or touching any part of her body—he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Overcome by lust:
having lust, longing for, in love with.
Distorted:
A desiring mind is distorted.
An angry mind is distorted.
A deluded mind is distorted.
But in this case “distorted” refers to the desiring mind.
a human female, not a female spirit, not a female ghost, not a female animal; even a girl born on that very day, all the more an older one.
Makes physical contact:
misconduct is what is meant.
from the elbow to the tip of the nails.
just the hair; or hair with strings in it, with a garland, with gold coins, with gold, with pearls, or with gems.
anything apart from the hand and the hair is called “any part of her body”.
Physical contact, touching, stroking downwards, stroking upwards, pulling down, raising up, pulling, pushing, squeezing, pressing, taking hold of, contacting.
Physical contact:
mere physical contact.
touching here and there.
Stroking downwards:
lowering down.
Stroking upwards:
raising up.
Pulling down:
Raising up:
sending away.
Squeezing:
taking hold of a bodily part and then pressing.
pressing with something.
Take hold of:
mere taking hold of.
Contacting:

Summary verses of case studies
“Mother, daughter, and sister,
Wife, and female spirit, _paṇḍaka_;
Asleep, dead, female animal,
And with a wooden doll.
About oppression, bridge, road,
Tree, and boat, and rope;
A staff, pushed with a bowl,
When paying respect, made an effort but did not touch.”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on anger
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realized perfection at the age of seven.
He had realized all there is to be realized by a disciple
and had nothing further to do.
While he was in seclusion he reflected on this,
and he thought, “How may I be of service to the Sangha?
Perhaps I could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the meals?”
In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and approached the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, while I was in seclusion I reflected that I’ve attained all that can be attained by a disciple, and I was wondering how I might be of service to the Sangha.
I could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the meals.”
“Good, good, Dabba,
please do so.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, the Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals.
And he should be appointed like this.
First Dabba should be asked.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals.
Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’”
Dabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their character.
He assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourses, thinking,
“They’ll recite the discourses together.”
And he did likewise for the experts on the Monastic Law, thinking,
“They’ll deliberate on the Monastic Law;”
for the expounders of the Teaching, thinking,
“They’ll discuss the Teaching;”
for the meditators, thinking,
“They won’t disturb each other;”
and for the gossips and the body-builders, thinking,
“In this way even these venerables will be happy.”
When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that light.
Monks even arrived late on purpose,
hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers.
They would approach Dabba and say,
“Venerable Dabba, assign us a dwelling.”
“Where would you like to stay?”
They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away,
“Please assign us a dwelling on the Vulture Peak,”
“… at Robbers’ Cliff,”
“… on Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili,”
“… in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra,”
“… in Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool,”
“… at Gotamaka Gorge,”
“… at Tinduka Gorge,”
“… at Tapoda Gorge,”
“… in Tapoda Park,”
“… in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove,”
“… in the deer park at Maddakucchi.”
Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks.
They followed closely behind him with the help of that light.
And he would assign them dwellings:
“This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the place for defecating, this the place for urinating, this the water for drinking, this the water for washing, this the walking stick;
these are the Sangha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to depart.”
Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove.
At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained. They had little merit,
and they obtained inferior dwellings and meals.
The people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—ghee, oil, and special foods—
but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.
After the meal, when they had returned from almsround, they asked the senior monks,
“What did you get at the dining hall?”
Some said,
“We got ghee, oil, and special curry.”
But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said,
“We didn’t get anything except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.”
At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks.
He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and children.
Some of them offered rice, others curry, others oil, and others special foods.
On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.
Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business.
He approached Dabba, bowed, and sat down.
Dabba then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
After the talk, he asked Dabba,
“Sir, who has been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?”
“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.”
He was disappointed, and thought,
“Why should bad monks eat in our house?”
After returning to his house, he told a female slave,
“For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridge.”
“Yes, sir.”
The monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each other,
“Yesterday we were designated a meal from that householder who offers fine food.
Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wives and children.
Some of them will offer us rice, others curry, others oil, and others special foods.”
And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night.
The following morning they robed up, took their bowls and robes, and went to the house of that householder.
When the female slave saw them coming, she prepared seats at the gateway and said to them,
“Please sit, Venerables.”
They thought,
“The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats at the gateway.”
She then brought them broken rice and porridge, and said,
“Eat, Sirs.”
“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.”
But yesterday I was told by the head of the household to serve you like this.
Please eat.”
They said to each other,
“Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba.
Dabba must be responsible for this split between this householder and us.”
And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended.
After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gateway, using their upper robe as a back-and-knee strap. They were silent and humiliated, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless.
Just then the nun Mettiyā approached them and said,
“I pay respect to you, Venerables.”
But they did not respond.
A second time
and a third time she said
the same thing,
but they still did not respond.
“Have I done something wrong?
Why don’t you respond?”
“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.”
“What can I do?”
“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.”
“What should I do? How am I able to do that?”
“Go to the Buddha and say,
‘Venerable Sir, this isn’t proper or appropriate.
There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist.
From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity.
It’s as if water is burning.
Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’”
Saying, “Alright,” she approached the Buddha, bowed,
and then repeated what she had been told to say.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba:
“Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?”
“Venerable Sir, you know about me.”
A second and
a third time the Buddha asked
the same question
and got the same response.
He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers.
If it was done by you, say so;
if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.”
“Sir, since I was born I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake.”
The Buddha addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā,
and call these monks to account.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā,
the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them,
“Don’t expel the nun Mettiyā;
she’s done nothing wrong.
She was urged on by us, because we were angry, displeased, and aiming to make Dabba leave the monastic life.”
“But did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?”
They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you groundlessly charged Dabba the Mallian with an offense entailing expulsion?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you groundlessly charge Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly charges a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life,
and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is groundless, and he admits to his ill will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The sub-chapter on robes
The third training rule on the robe-making season
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time a monk had been given robe-cloth outside the robe season.
While he was making the robe, he realized there was not enough cloth.
Lifting it up, he smoothed it out again and again.
While walking about the dwellings, the Buddha saw that monk acting in this way.
He approached him and said,
“What are you doing, monk?”
“Sir, I’ve been given this robe-cloth outside the robe season,
but it’s not enough to make a robe.
That’s why I lift it up and smooth it out again and again.”
“Are you expecting to receive more cloth?”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to keep out-of-season robe-cloth if you are expecting to receive more.”
When they knew that the Buddha had given this allowance, some monks kept out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month,
in a bundle on a bamboo robe-rack.
While walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw that robe-cloth,
and he asked the monks,
“Whose robe-cloth is this?”
“It’s our out-of-season robe-cloth, which we’re keeping because we’re expecting more.”
“How long have you kept this cloth?”
“More than a month.”
Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them,
“How can these monks keep out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can these foolish men keep out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if out-of-season robe-cloth is given to a monk, he may receive it if he wishes.
If he receives it, he should quickly make a robe.
If there is not enough cloth, but he is expecting more, he should keep it at most one month to make up the lack.
If he keeps it beyond that, even if he expects more cloth, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
When his robe is finished:
the monk has made a robe, or the robe-cloth has been lost, destroyed, or burnt, or he has abandoned his expectation of receiving further robe-cloth.
The robe-making season has ended:
it has ended according to one of the eight summaries or the Sangha has ended it, whichever comes first.
Out-of-season robe-cloth:
if the robe-making procedure has not been done, robe-cloth that is given during the eleven months.
If the robe-making procedure has been done, robe-cloth that is given during the seven months.
Also, if it is given in the robe season, but the cloth is designated, it is called “out-of-season robe-cloth”.
Is given by the Sangha, by a group, by a relative, or by a friend, or there are rags, or it is by means of his own property.
If he wishes:
if he desires, he may receive it.
If he receives it, he should quickly make a robe:
it should be made within ten days.
If there is not enough cloth:
if there is not enough cloth when the robe is being made.
He should keep it at most one month:
he should keep it for one month at the maximum.
To make up the lack:
for the purpose of making up the lack.
But he is expecting more:
he is expecting more from the Sangha, from a group, from a relative, or from a friend, or he is expecting to get rags, or he is expecting to get it by means of his own property.
If he keeps it beyond that, even if he expects more cloth:
If he is given the expected robe-cloth on the same day as he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days.
If he is given the expected robe-cloth two days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days.
If he is given the expected robe-cloth three days after …
four days after …
nineteen days after …
… twenty days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days.
If he is given the expected robe-cloth twenty-one days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within nine days.
If he is given the expected robe-cloth twenty-two days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within eight days. …
twenty-three days after …
twenty-eight days after …
If he is given the expected robe-cloth twenty-nine days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within one day.
If he is given the expected robe-cloth thirty days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be determined, transferred to another, or given away on that very day.
If he does not determine it, transfer it to another, or give it away, it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the thirty-first day.
The robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this out-of-season robe-cloth which I have kept for more than a month is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”
If he is given the expected robe-cloth, but it is different from the robe-cloth originally given to him, and there are days remaining, he does not have to make a robe if he does not want to.
If it is more than a month and he perceives it as more, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than a month, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than a month, but he perceives it as less, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been determined, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been transferred, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been given away, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been lost, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been destroyed, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been burnt, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been stolen, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he uses robe-cloth which should be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than a month, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than a month, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than a month and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.
if within a month it has been determined, transferred to another, given away, lost, destroyed, burnt, stolen, or taken on trust;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The third rule, the third training rule on the robe-making season, is finished.

The chapter on relinquishment
The sub-chapter on silk
The training rule on bartering
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had become skilled at making robes.
He made an upper robe of old cloth, well-dyed and beautifully executed, and he wore it.
Just then a certain wanderer who was wearing an an expensive robe approached Upananda and said,
“Your upper robe is beautiful.
Please give it to me in exchange for my robe.”
“But do you know what you’re doing?”
Saying, “Alright, then,” he gave it.
The wanderer put on the upper robe and went to the wanderers’ monastery.
And the wanderers said to him,
“This upper robe of yours is beautiful.
How did you get it?”
“I swapped it for my robe.”
“But how long will this upper robe last you?
That robe of yours was better.”
The wanderer realized they were right,
and so he returned to Upananda and said,
“Here’s your upper robe; give me back my robe.”
“But didn’t I ask you if you knew what you were doing?
I won’t give it back.”
Then that wanderer complained and criticized him,
“Even householders give back to other householders who have regrets.
How then can an ascetic not give back to another ascetic?”
The monks heard the complaints of that wanderer,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda,
“How can Venerable Upananda barter with a wanderer?”
After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda:
“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you barter with a wanderer?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk barters in various ways, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Various ways:
robes, almsfood, a dwelling, or medicines; even a bit of bath powder, a toothbrush, or a piece of string.
if he misbehaves, saying, “Give that for this,” “Bring that for this,” “Swap that with this,” “Exchange that for this,” he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When it has been bartered—his own goods are in the hands of the other and the other’s goods are in his own hands—it becomes subject to relinquishment.
The goods should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, I have bartered in various ways.
This is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this back to you.’”
If it is bartering, and he perceives it as such, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is bartering, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is bartering, but he does not perceive it as such, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is not bartering, but he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not bartering, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not bartering, and he does not perceive it as such, there is no offense.
if he asks for the price;
if he tells an attendant;
if he says, “I have this and I have need of such-and-such;”
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The tenth rule, the training rule on bartering, is finished.
The second sub-chapter on silk is finished.
This is the summary:
Silk, entirely, two parts,
Six years, sitting mat;
And two on wool, should take,
Two on various kinds.

The sub-chapter on robes
The training rule on asking non-relations
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was skilled at teaching.
On one occasion the son of a prominent merchant approached Upananda, bowed, and sat down.
And Upananda instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
Afterwards that merchant’s son said to Upananda:
“Venerable, please tell me what you need.
I’m able to give you robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines.”
“If you wish to give me something, then give me one of your wrap garments.”
“It’s shameful for the son of a good family to walk around in only one wrap.
Please wait until I get back home.
I’ll send you this wrap or a better one.”
A second time
and a third time Upananda said
the same thing to that merchant’s son,
and he got the same reply.
He then said, “What’s the point of inviting if you don’t want to give?”
Being pressured by Upananda, that merchant’s son gave him one of his wraps and left.
People asked him, “Why are you walking around in only one wrap?”
And he told them what had happened.
People complained and criticized him,
“These Sakyan ascetics have great desires; they are not content.
Even to make them an appropriate offer isn’t easy.
How can they take his wrap when the merchant’s son was making an appropriate offer?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda,
“How can Venerable Upananda ask the merchant’s son for a robe?”
After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda:
“Is it true, Upananda, that you acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
“Is he a relative of yours?”
“Foolish man, people who are not related don’t know what’s appropriate and what’s inappropriate in dealing with each other, what’s right and what’s wrong.
And still you asked the merchant’s son for a robe.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
At that time, while traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, a number of monks were robbed by bandits.
Knowing that the Buddha had laid down this training rule and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not ask for robes.
They walked naked to Sāvatthī and bowed down to the monks.
The monks said, “These Ājīvaka ascetics are good people, in that they bow down to the monks.”
“We’re not Ājīvakas; we’re monks!”
And the monks said to Venerable Upāli, “Upāli, please examine them.”
The naked monks then told Upāli what had happened, and he told the monks, “They are monks.
Give them robes.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can monks go naked?
Shouldn’t they have covered up with grass and leaves?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, if a monk’s robes are stolen or destroyed, I allow him to ask an unrelated householder for robes.
At the first monastery where he arrives, if the Sangha has a monastery robe, a bedspread, a floor cover, or a mattress cover, he should take that and put it on, thinking, ‘When I get a robe, I’ll return it.’
If there’s none of these things, he should cover up with grass and leaves before going on. He should not go on while naked.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: his robes are stolen or his robes are destroyed.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Unrelated:
anyone who is not a descendant of one’s male ancestors going back seven generations, either on the mother’s side or on the father’s side.
A male householder:
any man who lives at home.
A female householder:
any woman who lives at home.
one of the six kinds of robe-cloth, but not smaller than what can be transferred to another.
Except on an appropriate occasion:
unless it is an appropriate occasion.
His robes are stolen:
a monk’s robe is taken by kings, bandits, scoundrels, or anyone whomsoever.
His robes are destroyed:
a monk’s robe is burnt by fire, carried away by water, eaten by rats or termites, or worn through use.
If he asks, except on an appropriate occasion, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When he gets the robe-cloth, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
The robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this robe-cloth which I received after asking an unrelated householder, but not on an appropriate occasion, is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”
If the person is unrelated and the monk perceives them as such, and he asks them for a robe-cloth, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If the person is unrelated, but the monk is unsure of it, and he asks them for a robe-cloth, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If the person is unrelated, but the monk perceives them as related, and he asks them for a robe-cloth, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If the person is related, but the monk perceives them as unrelated, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the person is related, but the monk is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the person is related and the monk perceives them as such, there is no offense.
if he asks those who have given an invitation;
if he asks for the benefit of someone else;
if it is by means of his own property;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The sixth rule, the training rule on asking non-relations, is finished.

The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The sub-chapter on robes
The training rule on the robe-making season
Venerables, these thirty rules on relinquishment and confession come up for recitation.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī at the Gotamaka Shrine.
At that time the Buddha had allowed the three robes for the monks.
When they knew that the Buddha had allowed three robes, the monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three robes, stayed in the monastery in another set, and went to bathe in yet another set.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six keep extra robes?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you keep extra robes?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you keep extra robes?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk keeps an extra robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda was given an extra robe.
He wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputta
who was staying at Sāketa.
Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having extra robes, Ānanda thought,
“What should I do in this situation?”
He told the Buddha, who said,
“How long is it, Ānanda, before Sāriputta returns?”
“Nine or ten days.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, you should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, a monk should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most.
If he keeps it beyond that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
When his robe is finished:
the monk has made a robe, or the robe-cloth has been lost, destroyed, or burnt, or he has abandoned his expectation of receiving further robe-cloth.
The robe-making season has ended:
it has ended according to one of the eight summaries or the Sangha has ended it, whichever comes first.
For ten days at the most:
it should be kept for ten days at a maximum.
An extra robe:
a robe that is not determined, nor transferred to another.
one of the six kinds of robe-cloth, but not smaller than what can be transferred to another.
If he keeps it beyond that, it becomes subject to relinquishment:
it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eleventh day.
The robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, this robe-cloth that I have kept over ten days is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’
After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense.
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk.
The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This robe-cloth that was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so has been relinquished to the Sangha.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this robe-cloth back to monk so-and-so.’
After approaching several monks, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, this robe-cloth that I have kept over ten days is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the venerables.’
After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense.
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk.
The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
This robe-cloth that was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so has been relinquished to you.
If it seems appropriate to you, you should give this robe-cloth back to monk so-and-so.’
After approaching a single monk, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘This robe-cloth that I have kept over ten days is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to you.’
After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense.
The confession should be received by that monk.
The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back:
‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”
If it is more than ten days and he perceives it as more, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than ten days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than ten days, but he perceives it as less, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been determined, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been transferred, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been given away, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been lost, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been destroyed, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been burnt, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been stolen, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he uses robe-cloth that should be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than ten days, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than ten days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than ten days and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.
if within ten days it has been determined, transferred to another, given away, lost, destroyed, burnt, stolen, or taken on trust;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
At that time monks from the group six did not give back relinquished robe-cloth.
They told the Buddha.
“Monks, relinquished robe-cloth should be given back.
If you don’t give it back, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The first rule, the training rule on the robe-making season, is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The sub-chapter on robes
The training rule on storehouses
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to wander in the country with a lower and an upper robe.
Because they were stored for a long time, the robes became moldy.
The monks put them out in the sun.
While walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw the monks sunning those robes.
He asked them,
“Whose moldy robes are these?”
And they told him what had happened.
Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them,
“How can those monks store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to wander in the country with a lower and an upper robe?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can these foolish men store one of their robes with other monks and then leave to wander in the country with a lower and an upper robe?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
At one time a certain monk at Kosambī was sick.
The relatives of that monk sent him a message:
“Come, Venerable, we will nurse you.”
Other monks urged him to go,
but he said,
“The Buddha has laid down a training rule
that you can’t be apart from your three robes.
Because I’m sick,
I’m not able to travel with all three robes,
and therefore I can’t go.”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to stay apart from his three robes.
And it should be given like this.
After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I’m sick.
I’m not able to travel with my three robes.
I ask the Sangha for permission to stay apart from my three robes.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so is sick.
He is not able to travel with his three robes.
He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so is sick.
He is not able to travel with his three robes.
He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes.
The Sangha gives permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes.
Any monk who approves of giving permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
When his robe is finished:
the monk has made a robe, or the robe-cloth has been lost, destroyed, or burnt, or he has abandoned his expectation of receiving further robe-cloth.
The robe-making season has ended:
it has ended according to one of the eight summaries or the Sangha has ended it, whichever comes first.
If a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day:
from the outer robe, from the upper robe, or from the sarong.
Except if the monks have agreed:
unless the monks have agreed.
Entailing relinquishment:
it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn.
The robe should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this robe which I have stayed apart from for one day without the agreement of the monks is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this robe back to you.’”

The chapter on relinquishment
The training rule on what is intended
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time an association had prepared a meal together with robes for the Sangha,
intending to offer the robes after giving the meal.
But the monks from the group of six went to that association
“Please give these robes to us.”
“Venerables, we can’t do that.
We’ve prepared our annual alms-offering together with robes for the Sangha.”
“The Sangha has many donors and supporters.
But since we’re staying here, we look to you for support.
If you don’t give to us, then who will?
So give us these robes.”
Being pressured by the monks from the group of six, that association gave the prepared robes to them and served the food to the Sangha.
The monks who knew that a meal together with robes had been prepared for the Sangha, but who did not know that the robes had been given to those monks from the group six, said,
“You may offer the robes.”
“There isn’t any.
The robes we had prepared were diverted by the monks from the group of six to themselves.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six divert to themselves things they know were intended for the Sangha?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you divert to yourselves things that you know were intended for the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk diverts to himself material support that he knows was intended for the Sangha, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.

robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines; even a bit of bath powder, a toothbrush, or a piece of string.
they have said, “We’ll give,” “We’ll prepare.”
If he diverts it to himself, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When he gets it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
It should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this thing which I diverted to myself knowing that it was intended for the Sangha is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this back to you.’”
If it is intended for the Sangha and he perceives it as such, and he diverts it to himself, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is intended for the Sangha, but he is unsure of it, and he diverts it to himself, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is intended for the Sangha, but he does not perceives it as such, and he diverts it to himself, there is no offense.
If it is intended for one Sangha and he diverts it to another Sangha or to a shrine, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is intended for one shrine and he diverts it to another shrine or to a sangha or to an individual, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is intended for an individual and he diverts it to another individual or to a sangha or to a shrine, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not intended for the Sangha, but he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not intended for the Sangha, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not intended for the Sangha and he does not perceive it as such, there is no offense.
if being asked, “Where may we give?” he says, “Give where your gift goes toward equipment” “… where it goes toward repairs” “… where it will last for a long time” “… where you feel inspired;”

if he is the first offender.
The tenth rule, the training rule on what is intended, is finished.

You are pure in this and therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.”

The sub-chapter on silk
The training rule on sitting-blankets
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the monks: “Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for three months.
No one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.”
“Yes, Venerable Sir,” they replied, and no one approached him except the one who brought him almsfood.
Soon afterwards the Sangha at Sāvatthī made the following agreement:
“The Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three months.
No one is to approach him except the one who brings him almsfood.
Anyone who approaches him should be made to confess an offense entailing confession.”
Just then Venerable Upasena of Vaṅganta and his followers approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said this to Upasena,
“I hope you’re keeping well, Upasena, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.”
“We’re keeping well, Sir, we’re comfortable;
we’re not tired from traveling.”
One of Upasena’s students was seated not far from the Buddha, and the Buddha said to him,
“Do you like rag-robes, monk?”
“I don’t like rag-robes, Sir.”
“Why then do you wear them?”
“My preceptor wears them, and so I do it too.”
And the Buddha said to Upasena, “Upasena, your followers are inspiring.
How do you train them?”
“When anyone asks me for the full ordination, I tell him this:
‘I stay in the wilderness, I eat only almsfood, and I wear rag-robes.
If you do the same, I’ll give you the full ordination.’
If he agrees, I ordain him; otherwise I don’t.
And I do the same when anyone asks me for formal support.
It’s in this way that I train my followers.”
“Good, Upasena, you train your followers well.
But do you know the agreement made by the Sangha at Sāvatthī?”
“The Sangha at Sāvatthī has made the following agreement:
‘The Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three months.
No one is to approach him except the one who brings him almsfood.
Anyone who approaches him should be made to confess an offense entailing confession.’”
“Venerable Sir, the Sangha at Sāvatthī will become known for this agreement.
We, however, don’t lay down new rules, nor do we gets rid of the existing ones.
We practice and undertake the training rules as they are.”
“Good, Upasena.
One should not lay down new rules, nor should one gets rid of the existing ones.
One should practice and undertake the training rules as they are.
And, Upasena, I allow those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to come and visit me whenever they please.”
Just then a number of monks were standing outside the gateway, thinking, “We’ll make Venerable Upasena confess an offense entailing confession.”
Upasena and his followers got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left.
And those monks said to Upasena, “Upasena, do you know the agreement of the Sangha at Sāvatthī?”
“The Buddha asked me the same question, and I replied that I didn’t.
He then told me what it was, and I said,
‘Venerable Sir, the Sangha at Sāvatthī will become known for this agreement.
We, however, don’t lay down new rules, nor do we get rid of the existing ones.
We practice and undertake the training rules as they are.’
And the Buddha has allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to go and visit him whenever they please.”
Those monks thought, “It’s true what Venerable Upasena says.”
The monks heard that the Buddha had allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to go and visit him whenever they please.
Longing to see the Buddha, they discarded their blankets and undertook the practice of staying in the wilderness, of eating only almsfood, and of wearing rag-robes.
Soon afterwards the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, and he saw discarded blankets here and there.
He asked the monks, “Whose are these discarded blankets?”
The monks told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons:
for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk is having a sitting-blanket made, he must incorporate a one-standard-handspan piece from the border of an old blanket in order to make it ugly.
If he has a new sitting-blanket made without incorporating a one-standard-handspan piece from the border of an old blanket, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
sitting mat:
one with a border is what is meant.
A blanket:
it is made by strewing, not by weaving.
Is having made:
is making or is having made.
An old blanket:
even worn once.
He must incorporate a one-standard-handspan piece from the border in order to make it ugly:
to make it strong, he cuts out a circle or a rectangular piece, and he then incorporates it in one place or he strews it on after pulling it apart.
Without incorporating a one-standard-handspan piece from the border of an old blanket:
If he makes a new sitting-blanket, or has one made, without incorporating a one-standard-handspan piece from the border of an old blanket, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When he gets the sitting-blanket, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
The sitting-blanket should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this sitting-blanket which I had made without incorporating a one-standard-handspan piece from the border of an old blanket is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this sitting-blanket back to you.’”
If he finishes what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he gets others to finish what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he finishes himself what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he gets others to finish what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he makes one, or has one made, for the sake of another, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if he makes one incorporating a one-standard-handspan piece from the border of an old blanket;
if he is not able to obtain such a piece and he makes one incorporating a smaller piece;
if he is not able to obtain such a smaller piece and he makes one without;
if he obtains what was made by another and then uses it;
if he makes a canopy, a floor cover, a cloth screen, a mattress, or a pillow;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The fifth rule, the training rule on sitting-blankets, is finished.

The training rule on rainy-season robes
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the Buddha had allowed the rainy-season robe for the monks.
Knowing that this was the case, the monks from the group of six
went looking for cloth for their rainy-season robes early.
And after sewing them early, they wore them.
Then, because their rainy-season robes were worn, they bathed naked in the rain.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six go looking for cloth for their rainy-season robes early, sew them early, and then wear them, and then, because their rainy-season robes are worn, bathe naked in the rain?”
After rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you go looking for cloth for your rainy-season robes early, sew them early, and then wear them, and then, because your rainy-season robes are worn, bathe naked in the rain?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When there is a month left of the hot season, a monk may go looking for cloth for his rainy-season robe. When there is a half-month left, he may sew it and then wear it.
If he goes looking for cloth for his rainy-season robe when there is more than a month left of the hot season, or if he sews it and then wears it when there is more than a half-month left, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
When there is a month left of the hot season, a monk may go looking for cloth for his rainy-season robe:
after approaching those people who previously, too, have given cloth for the rainy-season robes, he should say, “It’s time for the rainy-season robe,” “It’s the occasion for the rainy-season robe,” “Other people, too, are giving cloth for the rainy-season robe.”
He should not say, “Give me cloth for the rainy-season robe,” “Bring me cloth for the rainy-season robe,” “Swap me cloth for the rainy-season robe,” “Buy me cloth for the rainy-season robe.”
When there is a half-month left, he may sew it and then wear it:
after sewing it during the last half-month of the hot season, he may wear it.
When there is more than a month left of the hot season:
if he goes looking for cloth for the rainy-season robe when there is more than a month left of the hot season, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
When there is more than a half-month left:
if he wears it after sewing it when there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
The rainy-season robe should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this cloth for the rainy-season robe which I went looking for when there was more than a month left of the hot season or which I wore after sewing it when there was more than a half-month left of the hot season is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this cloth for the rainy-season robe back to you.’”
If there is more than a month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as more, and he goes looking for cloth for a rainy-season robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If there is more than a month left of the hot season, but he is unsure of it, and he goes looking for cloth for a rainy-season robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If there is more than a month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as less, and he goes looking for cloth for a rainy-season robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as more, and he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, but he is unsure of it, and he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If there is more than a half-month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as less, and he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he has a rainy-season robe, but he bathes naked in the rain, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is less than a month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is less than a month left of the hot season, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is less than a month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.
If there is less than a half-month left of the hot season, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is less than a half-month left of the hot season, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is less than a half-month left of the hot season, and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.
if he goes looking for cloth for the rainy-season robe when there is a month left of the hot season;
if he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it when there is a half-month left of the hot season;
if he goes looking for cloth for the rainy-season robe when there is less than a month left of the hot season;
if he wears the rainy-season robe after sewing it when there is less than a half-month left of the hot season;
if, after looking for a rainy-season robe, he postpones the rainy-season residence;
if, after wearing a rainy-season robe, he postpones the rainy-season residence (in which case he should wash it and store it and then use it at the right time);
if his robe has been stolen;
if his robe has been lost;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The fourth rule, the training rule on rainy-season robes, is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The training rule on tonics
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Pilindavaccha, wanting to build a shelter, was having a hillside cleared near Rājagaha.
On that occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Venerable Elder, what are you having made?”
“I’m clearing the hillside, great king, because I want to build a shelter.”
“Do you need a monastery worker?”
“The Buddha hasn’t allowed monastery workers.”
“Well then, Sir, please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcome.”
“Yes, great king.”
And Pilindavaccha instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Bimbisāra with a teaching,
after which the king got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the Buddha:
“Venerable Sir, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery worker.
What should I do?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow monastery workers.”
Once again King Bimbisāra went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, and said,
“Venerable, has the Buddha allowed monastery workers?”
“Yes, great king.”
“Well then, I’ll provide you with a monastery worker.”
But after making this promise, he forgot, and only remembered after a long time. He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairs: “Listen, has the monastery worker I promised been provided?”
“No, sir, he hasn’t.”
“How long is it since we made that promise?”
The official counted the days and said, “It’s five hundred days.”
“Well then, provide him with five hundred monastery workers.”
The official provided Pilindavaccha with five hundred monastery workers and a separate village was established.
They called it “The Monastery Workers’ Village” and “Pilinda Village”.
And Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that village.
After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood.
At that time they were holding a celebration in that village and the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlands.
As Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of a certain monastery worker, where he sat down on a prepared seat.
Just then the daughter of the house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands, and she cried, “Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!”
Pilindavaccha asked her mother why the girl was crying.
She told him, adding, “How can poor people like us afford garlands and ornaments?”
Pilindavaccha took a roll of grass and said to the mother, “Here, place this pad of grass on the girl’s head.”
She did, and it turned into a beautiful golden garland.
Even the royal compound had nothing like it.
People told King Bimbisāra, “In the house of a particular monastery worker there’s a beautiful golden garland.
Even in your court, sir, there’s nothing like it.
So how did those poor people get it?
No doubt it was taken by theft.”
And King Bimbisāra had that family imprisoned.
Once again Pilindavaccha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood.
As he was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of that monastery worker. And he asked the neighbors, “Where is the family of this monastery worker?”
“Venerable, the king had them imprisoned because of that golden garland.”
Pilindavaccha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on a prepared seat.
King Bimbisāra approached Pilindavaccha, bowed, and sat down.
And Pilindavaccha said, “Great king, why have you had the family of that monastery worker imprisoned?”
“Sir, in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garland.
Even the royal compound has nothing like it.
So how did those poor people get it?
No doubt it was taken by theft.”
Pilindavaccha then focused his mind on turning King Bimbisāra’s stilt house into gold.
As a result the whole house became gold.
And he said, “Great king, how did you get so much gold?”
“Understood, Sir, this is your supernormal power.”
And he released that family.
People were saying, “It seems Venerable Pilindavaccha has performed a superhuman feat, a wonder of supernormal power, for the king and his court!”
Being delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha, they brought him the five tonics: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.
Ordinarily, too, Pilindavaccha was getting these five tonics.
Since he was getting so much, he gave it away to his followers.
As a consequence his followers acquired an abundance of tonics.
After filling up basins and waterpots and setting these aside, they filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windows.
The tonics were dripping all over and the dwellings became infested with rats.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics are hoarding goods indoors, just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can these monks choose to live in such abundance?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks are living like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men choose to live in such abundance?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘After being received, the tonics allowable for sick monks—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup—should be used from storage for at most seven days.
If one uses them beyond that, one commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
The tonics allowable for sick monks:
ghee from cows, ghee from goats, ghee from buffaloes, or ghee from whatever animal whose meat is allowable.
butter from the same animals.
sesame oil, mustard-seed oil, honey-tree oil, castor oil, oil from fat.
honey from bees.
from sugarcane.
After being received, they should be used from storage for at most seven days:
they are to be used for seven days at the maximum.
If one uses them beyond that, one commits an offense entailing relinquishment:
it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eighth day.
The tonics should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, they should be relinquished like this:
‘Venerables, these tonics that I have kept over seven days are to be relinquished.
I relinquish them to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give these tonics back to you.’”
If it is more than seven days and he perceives it as more, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than seven days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than seven days, but he perceives it as less, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If they have not been determined, but he perceives that they have, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If they have not been given away, but he perceives that they have, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If they have not been lost, but he perceives that they have, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If they have not been destroyed, but he perceives that they have, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If they have not been burnt, but he perceives that they have, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If they have not been stolen, but he perceives that they have, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
After the relinquished tonics have been returned, they are not to be used on the body, nor are they to be eaten.
They can used in lamps or as a black coloring agent.
Other monks may use them on the body, but they may not eat them.
If it is less than seven days, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than seven days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than seven days and he perceives it as less, there is no offense.
if within seven days they have been determined, given away, lost, destroyed, burnt, stolen, or taken on trust;
if, without any desire for them, he gives them up to a person who is not fully ordained, and he then obtains them again and then uses them;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The third rule, the training rule on tonics, is finished.

The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on relinquishment
The training rule on fewer than five mends
At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
At that time a potter had invited the monks:
“If any one of you needs a almsbowl, I’ll provide it.”
But the monks lacked a sense of moderation, and they asked for many bowls.
Those who had small bowls asked for large ones,
and those who had large bowls asked for small ones.
The potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make other goods for sale.
He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics not have any sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?
This potter is so busy making bowls for them that he is unable to make other goods for sale.
He is unable to make a living for himself, and his wives and children are suffering.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can those monks not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
After criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, a monk should not ask for an almsbowl.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards the bowl of a certain monk broke.
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited asking for a bowl and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not ask for a new one.
As a consequence he collected almsfood with his hands.
People complained and criticized him,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics collect almsfood with their hands, just like the ascetics of other religions?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to ask for a new almsbowl if your bowl has been lost or is broken.”
When they knew about the Buddha’s allowance, the monks from the group of six asked for many bowls even when their existing bowls only had a minor chip or scratch.
Once again that potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make other goods for sale.
He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered.
And people complained and criticized them as before.
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six ask for many bowls even if their existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you’re acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you ask for many bowls even if your existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk exchanges an almsbowl with fewer than five mends for a new almsbowl, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
That monk should relinquish that almsbowl to a gathering of monks.
He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: ‘Monk, this bowl is yours; keep it until it breaks.’
This is the proper procedure.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
An almsbowl with fewer than five mends:
it has no mends, one mend, two mends, three mends, or four mends.
An almsbowl with a mend that does not count:
one that does not have a 3.5 cm long fracture.
A almsbowl with a mend that counts:
one that has a 3.5 cm long fracture.
asked for is what is meant.
Exchanges:
If he asks, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When he gets the bowl, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
It should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha.
All determined bowls should be brought together.
You should not determine an inferior bowl, thinking,
“I’ll get a valuable bowl.”
If you determine an inferior bowl, thinking, “I’ll get a valuable bowl,” you commits an offense of wrong conduct.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, this almsbowl that I got in exchange for a bowl that had fewer than five mends is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’”
After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense.
The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk.
A monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the distributor of almsbowls:
one who is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows what has and has not been distributed.
“And, monks, this is how he should be appointed.
First the monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls.
Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls should remain silent.
Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent.
I will remember it thus.’”
The appointed monk should give away that bowl.
He should tell the most senior monk,
“Sir, would you like this bowl?”
If the most senior monk takes it, his bowl should be offered to the next monk.
He should not not take that bowl out of sympathy.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
It is not to be offered to anyone who does not have bowl.
In this manner it should be offered all the way to the most junior monk in the Sangha.
He is then to be given the last bowl belonging to that gathering of monks: “Monk, this bowl is yours; keep it until it breaks”:
That monk is not to store that bowl in an unsuitable place, to use it in an unsuitable way, or to give it away, thinking, “How may this bowl be lost, destroyed, or broken?”
If he stores it in an unsuitable place, uses it in an unsuitable way, or gives it away, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
This is the proper procedure:
this is the right method.

The training rule on asking for thread
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
On one occasion when the monks from the group of six were making robes, they asked for a large amount of thread.
Yet even when their robes had been sewn, there was much thread left over.
They said,
“Well, let’s ask for more thread and have weavers weave us robe-cloth.”
Yet even when the robe-cloth had been woven, there was much thread left over.
A second time they asked for more thread and had weavers weave them robe-cloth.
Once again there was much thread left over.
A third time they asked for more thread and had weavers weave them robe-cloth.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics ask for thread and then have weavers weave them robe-cloth?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six ask for thread and then have weavers weave them robe-cloth?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you ask for thread and then have weavers weave you robe-cloth?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk himself asks for thread, and then has weavers weave him robe-cloth, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
he himself has asked.
there are six kinds of thread:
linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp.
If he has it woven by weavers, then for every effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When he gets the robe-cloth, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
The robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this robe-cloth which I had weavers weave after asking for the thread myself is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”
If he had it woven, and he perceives that he did, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he had it woven, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he had it woven, but he does not perceive that he did, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If he did not have it woven, but he perceives that he did, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he did not have it woven, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he did not have it woven, and he does not perceive that he did, there is no offense.

if it is for a belt;

The training rule on what is risky
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time monks who had completed the rainy-season residence were staying in wilderness dwellings.
Thieves who were active during the month of Kattika attacked the monks, thinking,
“They have obtained things.”
The monks told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow monks who are staying in wilderness dwellings to store one of their three robes in an inhabited area.”
Knowing that the Buddha had made this allowance, monks stored one of their three robes in inhabited areas, and they stayed apart from them for more than six days.
The robes were lost, destroyed, burnt, and eaten by rats.
As a consequence those monks became poorly dressed.
Other monks asked them why,
and they told them what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can those monks store one of their three robes in an inhabited area and then stay apart from it for more than six days?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… Monks, how can those foolish men store one of their three robes in an inhabited area and then stay apart from it for more than six days?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. After observing the Kattika full moon that ends the rainy season, a monk who is staying in such a dwelling may store one of his three robes in an inhabited area, if he so desires, so long as he has a reason for staying apart from that robe.
He should stay apart from that robe for six days at the most.
If he stays apart from it beyond that, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
After observing:
after completing the rainy season.
The Kattika full moon that ends the rainy season:
the fourth full moon of the rainy season in the month of Kattika is what is meant.
There are wilderness dwellings:
a wilderness dwelling:
it is at least 800 meters away from any inhabited area.
in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, thieves have been seen camping, eating, standing, seated, or lying down.
Dangerous:
in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, thieves have been seen injuring, robbing, or beating people.
A monk who is staying in such a dwelling:
a monk who is staying in that kind of dwelling.
If he so desires:
One of his three robes:
the outer robe, the upper robe, or the sarong.
May store in an inhabited area:
may store it anywhere in his alms village.
So long as he has a reason for staying apart from that robe:
if there is a reason, if there is something to be done.
He should stay apart from that robe for six days at the most:
he should stay apart from it for six days at the maximum.
Except if the monks have agreed:
unless the monks have agreed.
If he stays apart from it beyond that:
the robe becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the seventh day.
The robe should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual.
“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this robe which I have stayed apart from for more than six days without the agreement of the monks is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this robe back to you.’”
If it is more than six days and he perceives it as more and he is staying apart from it, then, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than six days, but he is unsure of it, and he is staying apart from it, then, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than six days, but he perceives it as less, and he is staying apart from it, then, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If the determination has not been given up, but he perceives that it has …
If the robe has not been given away, but he perceives that it has …
