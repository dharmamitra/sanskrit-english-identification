And that’s just what they did.
And they saw where the third herd of deer had their lair, where they went to hide out.
And that’s how the third herd failed to get free from the trapper’s power.
So then a fourth herd of deer thought up a plan,
‘The first …
and third herds of deer …
failed to get free of the trapper’s power.
Why don’t we set up our lair somewhere the trapper and his companions can’t go? Then we can intrude on where the trapper has cast the bait and enjoy eating it without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then we won’t be vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait.’
And that’s just what they did.
So the trapper and his companions thought,
‘Wow, this fourth herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of unnatural spirits with psychic power!
For they eat the bait we’ve cast without us knowing how they come and go.
Why don’t we surround the bait on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see their lair, where they go to hide out.’
And that’s just what they did.
But they couldn’t see where the fourth herd of deer had their lair, where they went to hide out.
So the trapper and his companions thought,
‘If we disturb this fourth herd of deer, they’ll disturb others, who in turn will disturb even more.
Then all of the deer will be free from this bait we’ve cast.
Why don’t we just keep an eye on that fourth herd?’
And that’s just what they did.
And that’s how the fourth herd of deer got free from the trapper’s power.
I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is what it means.
‘Bait’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
‘Trapper’ is a term for Māra the Wicked.
‘Trapper’s companions’ is a term for Māra’s assembly.
‘Deer’ is a term for ascetics and brahmins.
Now, the first group of ascetics and brahmins intruded on where the bait and the material delights of the world were cast by Māra and recklessly enjoyed eating it.
They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then they were vulnerable to Māra on account of that bait and the material delights of the world.
And that’s how the first group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.
This first group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the first herd of deer, I say.
So then a second group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,
‘The first group of ascetics and brahmins became indulgent …
and failed to get free of Māra’s power.
Why don’t we avoid eating the bait and the world’s material delights altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’
And that’s just what they did.
They ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin,
and they lost their strength and energy.
Because of this, they lost their heart’s release,
so they went back to that same place where Māra had cast the bait and the material delights of the world.
Intruding on that place, they recklessly enjoyed eating them …
And that’s how the second group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.
This second group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the second herd of deer, I say.
So then a third group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,
‘The first …
and second groups of ascetics and brahmins …
failed to get free of Māra’s power.
Why don’t we set up our lair close by the place where Māra has cast the bait and those material delights of the world? Then we can intrude on it and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then we won’t be vulnerable to Māra on account of that bait and those material delights of the world.’
And that’s just what they did.
Still, they had such views as these:
‘The cosmos is eternal’ or ‘The cosmos is not eternal’;
‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’;
‘The soul and the body are the same thing’ or ‘The soul and the body are different things’;
or that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
And that’s how the third group of ascetics and brahmins failed to get free from Māra’s power.
This third group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the third herd of deer, I say.
So then a fourth group of ascetics and brahmins thought up a plan,
‘The first …
and third groups of ascetics and brahmins …
failed to get free of Māra’s power.
Why don’t we set up our lair somewhere Māra and his assembly can’t go?
Then we can intrude on where Māra has cast the bait and those material delights of the world, and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then we won’t be vulnerable to Māra on account of that bait and those material delights of the world.’
And that’s just what they did.
And that’s how the fourth group of ascetics and brahmins got free from Māra’s power.
This fourth group of ascetics and brahmins is just like the fourth herd of deer, I say.
And where is it that Māra and his assembly can’t go?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.
And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. And they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them,
“Mendicants, could a bad person know of a bad person:
‘This fellow is a bad person’?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know of a bad person:
‘This fellow is a bad person.’
But could a bad person know of a good person:
‘This fellow is a good person’?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
That too is impossible.
A bad person has bad qualities, associates with bad people, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of a bad person.
And how does a bad person have bad qualities?
It’s when a bad person is faithless, shameless, imprudent, uneducated, lazy, unmindful, and witless.
That’s how a bad person has bad qualities.
And how does a bad person associate with bad people?
It’s when a bad person is a friend and companion of ascetics and brahmins who are faithless, shameless, imprudent, uneducated, lazy, unmindful, and witless.
That’s how a bad person associates with bad people.
And how does a bad person have the intentions of a bad person?
It’s when a bad person intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both.
That’s how a bad person has the intentions of a bad person.
And how does a bad person offer the counsel of a bad person?
It’s when a bad person offers counsel that hurts themselves, hurts others, and hurts both.
That’s how a bad person offers the counsel of a bad person.
And how does a bad person have the speech of a bad person?
It’s when a bad person uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical.
That’s how a bad person has the speech of a bad person.
And how does a bad person have the action of a bad person?
It’s when a bad person kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct.
That’s how a bad person has the actions of a bad person.
And how does a bad person have the view of a bad person?
It’s when a bad person has such a view:
‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
That’s how a bad person has the view of a bad person.
And how does a bad person give the gifts of a bad person?
It’s when a bad person gives a gift carelessly, not with their own hand, and thoughtlessly. They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for consequences.
That’s how a bad person gives the gifts of a bad person.
That bad person—who has such bad qualities, frequents bad people, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of a bad person—
when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the place where bad people are reborn.
And what is the place where bad people are reborn?
Hell or the animal realm.
Mendicants, could a good person know of a good person:
‘This fellow is a good person’?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
It is possible that a good person could know of a good person:
‘This fellow is a good person.’
But could a good person know of a bad person:
‘This fellow is a bad person’?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
That too is possible.
A good person has good qualities, associates with good people, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of a good person.
And how does a good person have good qualities?
It’s when a good person is faithful, conscientious, prudent, learned, energetic, mindful, and wise.
That’s how a good person has good qualities.
And how does a good person associate with good people?
It’s when a good person is a friend and companion of ascetics and brahmins who are faithful, conscientious, prudent, learned, energetic, mindful, and wise.
That’s how a good person associates with good people.
And how does a good person have the intentions of a good person?
It’s when a good person doesn’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both.
That’s how a good person has the intentions of a good person.
And how does a good person offer the counsel of a good person?
It’s when a good person offers counsel that doesn’t hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both.
That’s how a good person offers the counsel of a good person.
And how does a good person have the speech of a good person?
It’s when a good person refrains from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.
That’s how a good person has the speech of a good person.
And how does a good person have the action of a good person?
It’s when a good person refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct.
That’s how a good person has the action of a good person.
And how does a good person have the view of a good person?
It’s when a good person has such a view:
‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are duties to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
That’s how a good person has the view of a good person.
And how does a good person give the gifts of a good person?
It’s when a good person gives a gift carefully, with their own hand, and thoughtfully. They don’t give the dregs, and they give with consideration for consequences.
That’s how a good person gives the gifts of a good person.
That good person—who has such good qualities, associates with good people, and has the intentions, counsel, speech, actions, views, and giving of a good person—
when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the place where good people are reborn.
And what is the place where good people are reborn?
A state of greatness among gods or humans.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Mindfulness Meditation
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
What four?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Observing the Body
Mindfulness of Breathing
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there.
Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.
When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.
They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.
It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
The Postures
Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’
Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Situational Awareness
Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Focusing on the Repulsive
Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice.
And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents:
‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Focusing on the Elements
Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements:
‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’
It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
The Charnel Ground Contemplations
Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …
A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …
Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull …
White bones, the color of shells …
Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile …
Bones rotted and crumbled to powder.
They’d compare it with their own body:
‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.
Observing the Feelings
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings?
It’s when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’
When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’
When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’
When they feel a material pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material pleasant feeling.’
When they feel a spiritual pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling.’
When they feel a material painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material painful feeling.’
When they feel a spiritual painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual painful feeling.’
When they feel a material neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material neutral feeling.’
When they feel a spiritual neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual neutral feeling.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the feelings internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing feelings as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that feelings exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings.
Observing the Mind
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind?
It’s when a mendicant understands mind with greed as ‘mind with greed,’
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed.’
They understand mind with hate as ‘mind with hate,’
and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate.’
They understand mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion,’
and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion.’
They know constricted mind as ‘constricted mind,’
and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind.’
They know expansive mind as ‘expansive mind,’
and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind.’
They know mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme,’
and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme.’
They know mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi,’
and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi.’
They know freed mind as ‘freed mind,’
and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the mind as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that the mind exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the mind.
Observing Principles
The Hindrances
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances.
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances?
It’s when a mendicant who has sensual desire in them understands: ‘I have sensual desire in me.’ When they don’t have sensual desire in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have sensual desire in me.’ They understand how sensual desire arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.
When they have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I have ill will in me.’ When they don’t have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have ill will in me.’ They understand how ill will arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.
When they have dullness and drowsiness in them, they understand: ‘I have dullness and drowsiness in me.’ When they don’t have dullness and drowsiness in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have dullness and drowsiness in me.’ They understand how dullness and drowsiness arise; how, when they’ve already arisen, they’re given up; and how, once they’re given up, they don’t arise again in the future.
When they have restlessness and remorse in them, they understand: ‘I have restlessness and remorse in me.’ When they don’t have restlessness and remorse in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have restlessness and remorse in me.’ They understand how restlessness and remorse arise; how, when they’ve already arisen, they’re given up; and how, once they’re given up, they don’t arise again in the future.
When they have doubt in them, they understand: ‘I have doubt in me.’ When they don’t have doubt in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have doubt in me.’ They understand how doubt arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances.
The Aggregates
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five grasping aggregates.
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five grasping aggregates?
It’s when a mendicant contemplates:
‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.
Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.
Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally …
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five grasping aggregates.
The Sense Fields
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the six interior and exterior sense fields.
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the six interior and exterior sense fields?
It’s when a mendicant understands the eye, sights, and the fetter that arises dependent on both of these. They understand how the fetter that has not arisen comes to arise; how the arisen fetter comes to be abandoned; and how the abandoned fetter comes to not rise again in the future.
They understand the ear, sounds, and the fetter …
They understand the nose, smells, and the fetter …
They understand the tongue, tastes, and the fetter …
They understand the body, touches, and the fetter …
They understand the mind, thoughts, and the fetter that arises dependent on both of these. They understand how the fetter that has not arisen comes to arise; how the arisen fetter comes to be abandoned; and how the abandoned fetter comes to not rise again in the future.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally …
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the six internal and external sense fields.
The Awakening Factors
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors.
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors?
It’s when a mendicant who has the awakening factor of mindfulness in them understands: ‘I have the awakening factor of mindfulness in me.’ When they don’t have the awakening factor of mindfulness in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have the awakening factor of mindfulness in me.’ They understand how the awakening factor of mindfulness that has not arisen comes to arise; and how the awakening factor of mindfulness that has arisen becomes fulfilled by development.
When they have the awakening factor of investigation of principles …
tranquility …
immersion …
equanimity in them, they understand: ‘I have the awakening factor of equanimity in me.’ When they don’t have the awakening factor of equanimity in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have the awakening factor of equanimity in me.’ They understand how the awakening factor of equanimity that has not arisen comes to arise; and how the awakening factor of equanimity that has arisen becomes fulfilled by development.
And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors.
The Truths
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.
And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths?
It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’
And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally.
They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish.
Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness.
They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.
That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.
Anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven years can expect one of two results:
enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.
Let alone seven years,
anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for six years …
five years …
four years …
three years …
two years …
one year …
seven months …
six months …
five months …
four months …
three months …
two months …
one month …
a fortnight …
Let alone a fortnight,
anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven days can expect one of two results:
enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.
‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Māgaṇḍiya
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma, on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kammāsadamma for alms.
He wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.
Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.
Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber.
He saw the grass mat spread out there
and asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan,
“Mister Bhāradvāja, who has this grass mat been spread out for? It looks like an ascetic’s bed.”
“There is the ascetic Gotama, a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
This bed has been spread for that Master Gotama.”
“Well, it’s a sad sight, Mister Bhāradvāja,
a very sad sight indeed,
to see a bed for Master Gotama, that life-destroyer!”
“Be careful what you say, Māgaṇḍiya,
be careful what you say.
Many astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics are devoted to Master Gotama. They’ve been guided by him in the noble method, the skillful teaching.”
“Even if I was to see Master Gotama face to face, Mister Bhāradvāja, I would say to his face:
‘The ascetic Gotama is a life-destroyer.’
Why is that?
Because that’s what it implies in a discourse of ours.”
“If you don’t mind, I’ll tell the ascetic Gotama about this.”
“Don’t worry, Mister Bharadvāja. You may tell him exactly what I’ve said.”
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya.
Coming out of retreat, he went to the brahmin’s fire chamber and sat on the grass mat.
Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Bhāradvāja, did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass mat?”
When he said this, the brahmin said to the Buddha,
“I wanted to mention this very thing to Master Gotama,
but you brought it up before I had a chance.”
But this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinished.
Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to him:
“Māgaṇḍiya, the eye likes sights, it loves them and enjoys them.
That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.
Is that what you were referring to when you called me
a life-destroyer?”
“That’s exactly what I was referring to.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it implies in a discourse of ours.”
“The ear likes sounds …
The nose likes smells …
The tongue likes tastes …
The body likes touches …
The mind likes thoughts, it loves them and enjoys them.
That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint.
Is that what you were referring to when you called me
a life-destroyer?”
“That’s exactly what I was referring to.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it implies in a discourse of ours.”
“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Take someone who used to amuse themselves with sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sights, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sights—they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.
What would you have to say to them, Māgaṇḍiya?”
“Nothing, Master Gotama.”
“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Take someone who used to amuse themselves with sounds known by the ear …
smells known by the nose …
tastes known by the tongue …
touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of touches, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for touches—they would live rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside.
What would you have to say to them, Māgaṇḍiya?”
“Nothing, Master Gotama.”
“Well, when I was still a layperson I used to amuse myself, supplied and provided with sights known by the eye … sounds known by the ear …
smells known by the nose …
tastes known by the tongue …
touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
I had three stilt longhouses—
one for the rainy season, one for the winter, and one for the summer.
I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men.
Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasures—I live rid of thirst, my mind peaceful inside.
I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.
I don’t envy them, nor do I hope to enjoy that.
Why is that?
Because there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities,
which even achieves the level of heavenly pleasure.
Enjoying that satisfaction, I don’t envy what is inferior, nor do I hope to enjoy it.
Suppose there was a householder or a householder’s child who was rich, affluent, and wealthy. And they would amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. That is, sights known by the eye …
touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Having practiced good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.
There they’d amuse themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.
Then they’d see a householder or a householder’s child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya? Would that god—amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation—envy that householder or householder’s child their five kinds of human sensual stimulation, or return to human sensual pleasures?”
“No, Master Gotama.
Why is that?
Because heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures.”
“In the same way, Māgaṇḍiya, when I was still a layperson I used to entertain myself with sights … sounds …
touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasures—I live rid of thirst, my mind peaceful inside.
I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures. I don’t envy them, nor do I hope to enjoy that.
Why is that?
Because there is a satisfaction that is apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities,
which even achieves the level of heavenly pleasure.
Enjoying that satisfaction, I don’t envy what is inferior, nor do I hope to enjoy it.
Suppose there was a person affected by leprosy, with sores and blisters on their limbs. Being devoured by worms, scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds, they’d cauterize their body over a pit of glowing coals.
Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them.
The field surgeon would make medicine for them,
and by using that they’d be cured of leprosy. They’d be healthy, happy, autonomous, master of themselves, able to go where they wanted.
Then they’d see another person affected by leprosy, with sores and blisters on their limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds, cauterizing their body over a pit of glowing coals.
What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Would that person envy that other person affected by leprosy for their pit of glowing coals or for taking medicine?”
“No, Master Gotama.
Why is that?
Because you need to take medicine only when there’s a disease. When there’s no disease, there’s no need for medicine.”
“In the same way, Māgaṇḍiya, when I was still a layperson I used to entertain myself with sights … sounds …
touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Some time later—having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and having given up craving and dispelled passion for sensual pleasures—I live rid of thirst, my mind peaceful inside.

Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them.
The field surgeon would make medicine for them,
and by using that they’d be cured of leprosy. They’d be healthy, happy, autonomous, master of themselves, able to go where they wanted.
Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals.
What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Wouldn’t that person writhe and struggle to and fro?”
“Yes, Master Gotama.
Why is that?
Because that fire is really painful to touch, fiercely burning and scorching.”
“What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Is it only now that the fire is really painful to touch, fiercely burning and scorching, or was it painful previously as well?”
“That fire is painful now and it was also painful previously.
That person was affected by leprosy, with sores and blisters on their limbs. Being devoured by worms, scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds, their sense faculties were impaired. So even though the fire was actually painful to touch, they had a distorted perception that it was pleasant.”
“In the same way, sensual pleasures of the past, future, and present are painful to touch, fiercely burning and scorching.
These sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures—being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures—have impaired sense faculties. So even though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they have a distorted perception that they are pleasant.
Suppose there was a person affected by leprosy, with sores and blisters on their limbs. Being devoured by worms, scratching with their nails at the opening of their wounds, they’re cauterizing their body over a pit of glowing coals.
The more they scratch their wounds and cauterize their body, the more their wounds become foul, stinking, and infected. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the itchiness of their wounds.
In the same way, I see other sentient beings who are not free from sensual pleasures being consumed by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with passion for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures.
The more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures grows, and the more they burn with passion for sensual pleasures. But still, they derive a degree of pleasure and gratification from the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Have you seen or heard of a king or a royal minister of the past, future, or present, amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, who—without giving up craving for sensual pleasures and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures—lives rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“Good, Māgaṇḍiya.
Neither have I.
On the contrary, all the ascetics or brahmins of the past, future, or present who live rid of thirst, their minds peaceful inside, do so after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sensual pleasures, and after giving up craving and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures.”
Then on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
“Health is the ultimate blessing;
extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.
Of paths, the ultimate is eightfold—
it’s safe, and leads to the deathless.”
When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him,
“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing!
How well said this was by Master Gotama!
‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’
I’ve also heard that wanderers of the past, the teachers of teachers, said:
‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’
And it agrees, Master Gotama.”
“But Māgaṇḍiya, when you heard that wanderers of the past said this,
what is that health? And what is that extinguishment?”
When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya stroked his own limbs with his hands, saying:
“This is that health, Master Gotama, this is that extinguishment!
For I am now healthy and happy, and have no afflictions.”
“Māgaṇḍiya, suppose a person was born blind.
They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun.
They might hear a sighted person saying:
‘White cloth is really nice, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.’
They’d go in search of white cloth.
But someone would cheat them with a dirty, soiled garment, saying:
‘Sir, here is a white cloth for you, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.’
They’d take it and put it on, expressing their gladness:
‘White cloth is really nice, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.’
What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Did that person blind from birth do this knowing and seeing,
or out of faith in the sighted person?”
“They did so not knowing or seeing,
but out of faith in the sighted person.”
“In the same way, the wanderers who follow other paths are blind and sightless. Not knowing health and not seeing extinguishment, they still recite this verse:
‘Health is the ultimate blessing; extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.’
For this verse was recited by the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas of the past:
‘Health is the ultimate blessing;
extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.
Of paths, the ultimate is eightfold—
it’s safe, and leads to the deathless.'
These days it has gradually become a verse used by ordinary people.
But Māgaṇḍiya, this body is a disease, an abscess, a dart, a misery, an affliction. Yet you say of this body:
‘This is that health, this is that extinguishment!’
Māgaṇḍiya, you don’t have the noble vision by which you might know health and see extinguishment.”
“I am quite confident that Master Gotama
is capable of teaching me so that I can know health and see extinguishment.”
“Māgaṇḍiya, suppose a person was born blind.
They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun.
Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them.
The field surgeon would make medicine for them,
but when they used it their eyes were not cured and they still could not see clearly.
What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?
Wouldn’t that doctor just get weary and frustrated?”
“Yes, Master Gotama.”
“In the same way, suppose I were to teach you the Dhamma, saying:
‘This is that health, this is that extinguishment.’ But you might not know health or see extinguishment,
which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”
“I am quite confident that Master Gotama
is capable of teaching me so that I can know health and see extinguishment.”
“Māgaṇḍiya, suppose a person was born blind.
They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun.
They might hear a sighted person saying:
‘White cloth is really nice, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.’
They’d go in search of white cloth.
But someone would cheat them with a dirty, soiled garment, saying:
‘Sir, here is a white cloth for you, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.’
They’d take it and put it on.
Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them.
The field surgeon would make medicine for them:
emetics, purgatives, ointment, counter-ointment, or nasal treatment.
And when they used it their eyes would be cured so that they could see clearly.
As soon as their eyes were cured they’d lose all desire for that dirty, soiled garment.
Then they would consider that person to be no friend, but an enemy, and might even think of murdering them:
‘For such a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by that person with this dirty, soiled garment when he said,
“Sir, here is a white cloth for you, it’s attractive, stainless, and clean.”’
In the same way, Māgaṇḍiya, suppose I were to teach you the Dhamma, saying:
‘This is that health, this is that extinguishment.’
You might know health and see extinguishment.
And as soon as your vision arises you might give up desire for the five grasping aggregates.
And you might even think:
‘For such a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by this mind.
For what I have been grasping is only form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
My grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.’”
“I am quite confident that Master Gotama
is capable of teaching me so that I can rise from this seat cured of blindness.”
“Well then, Māgaṇḍiya, you should associate with good people.
When you associate with good people, you will hear the true teaching.
When you hear the true teaching, you’ll practice in line with the teaching.
When you practice in line with the teaching, you’ll know and see for yourself:
‘These are diseases, boils, and darts.
And here is where diseases, boils, and darts cease without anything left over.’
When my grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”
When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
“Māgaṇḍiya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.
However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”
“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”
And the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Māgaṇḍiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Māgaṇḍiya became one of the perfected.
Middle Discourses
The Analysis of the Elements
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the Magadhan lands when he arrived at Rājagaha.
He went to see Bhaggava the potter, and said,
“Bhaggava, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in your workshop.”
“It’s no trouble, sir.
But there’s a renunciate already staying there.
If he allows it, sir, you may stay as long as you like.”
Now at that time a gentleman named Pukkusāti had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in the Buddha.
And it was he who had first taken up residence in the workshop.
Then the Buddha approached Venerable Pukkusāti and said,
“Mendicant, if it is no trouble, I’d like to spend a single night in the workshop.”
“The potter’s workshop is spacious, reverend.
Please stay as long as you like.”
Then the Buddha entered the workshop and spread out a grass mat to one side. He sat down cross-legged, with his body straight, and established mindfulness right there.
He spent most of the night sitting meditation,
and so did Pukkusāti.
Then it occurred to the Buddha,
“This gentleman’s conduct is impressive.
Why don’t I question him?”
So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,
“In whose name have you gone forth, reverend?
Who is your Teacher?
Whose teaching do you believe in?”
“Reverend, there is the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
I’ve gone forth in his name.
That Blessed One is my Teacher,
and I believe in his teaching.”
“But mendicant, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”
“In the northern lands there is a city called Sāvatthī.
There the Blessed One is now staying, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”
“But have you ever seen that Buddha?
Would you recognize him if you saw him?”
“No, I’ve never seen him,
and I wouldn’t recognize him if I did.”
Then it occurred to the Buddha,
“This gentleman has gone forth in my name.
Why don’t I teach him the Dhamma?”
So the Buddha said to Pukkusāti,
“Mendicant, I shall teach you the Dhamma.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied Pukkusāti.
The Buddha said this:
“‘This person has six elements, six fields of contact, and eighteen mental preoccupations.
They have four foundations, standing on which the streams of identification don’t flow. And when the streams of identification don’t flow, they’re called a sage at peace.
Don’t neglect wisdom, preserve truth, foster generosity, and train only for peace.’
This is the recitation passage for the analysis of the elements.
‘This person has six elements.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these six elements:
the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.
‘This person has six elements.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘This person has six fields of contact.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
The fields of contact of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
‘This person has six fields of contact.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘This person has eighteen mental preoccupations.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
Hearing a sound with the ear …
Smelling an odor with the nose …
Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
Feeling a touch with the body …
Becoming conscious of a thought with the mind, one is preoccupied with a thought that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity.
‘This person has eighteen mental preoccupations.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘This person has four foundations.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
The foundations of wisdom, truth, generosity, and peace.
‘This person has four foundations.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Don’t neglect wisdom, preserve truth, foster generosity, and train only for peace.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
And how does one not neglect wisdom?
There are these six elements:
the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.
And what is the earth element?
The earth element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior earth element?
Anything hard, solid, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes
head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, or anything else hard, solid, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior earth element.
The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.
And what is the water element?
The water element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior water element?
Anything that’s water, watery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes
bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine, or anything else that’s water, watery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior water element.
The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the water element, detaching the mind from the water element.
And what is the fire element?
The fire element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior fire element?
Anything that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes
that which warms, that which ages, that which heats you up when feverish, that which properly digests food and drink, or anything else that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior fire element.
The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the fire element, detaching the mind from the fire element.
And what is the air element?
The air element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior air element?
Anything that’s air, airy, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes
winds that go up or down, winds in the belly or the bowels, winds that flow through the limbs, in-breaths and out-breaths, or anything else that’s air, airy, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior air element.
The interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the air element, detaching the mind from the air element.
And what is the space element?
The space element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior space element?
Anything that’s space, spacious, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes
the ear canals, nostrils, and mouth; and the space for swallowing what is eaten and drunk, the space where it stays, and the space for excreting it from the nether regions.
This is called the interior space element.
The interior space element and the exterior space element are just the space element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the space element, detaching the mind from the space element.
There remains only consciousness, pure and bright.
And what does that consciousness know?
It knows ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ and ‘neutral’.
Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
When they feel a pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’
They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.’
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’
They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops.’
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.
When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’
They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.’
When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops.
In the same way, pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. …
They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.’
There remains only equanimity, pure, bright, pliable, workable, and radiant.
It’s like when a goldsmith or a goldsmith’s apprentice prepares a forge, fires the crucible, picks up some gold with tongs and puts it in the crucible. From time to time they fan it, from time to time they sprinkle water on it, and from time to time they just watch over it. That gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and is ready to be worked. Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland.
In the same way, there remains only equanimity, pure, bright, pliable, workable, and radiant.
They understand:
‘If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite space, my mind would develop accordingly.
And this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.
If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite consciousness, my mind would develop accordingly.
And this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.
If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of nothingness, my mind would develop accordingly.
And this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.
If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, my mind would develop accordingly.
And this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.’
They understand:
‘If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite space, my mind would develop accordingly.
But that is conditioned.
If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite consciousness …
nothingness …
neither perception nor non-perception, my mind would develop accordingly.
But that is conditioned.’
They neither make a choice nor form an intention to continue existence or to end existence.
Because of this, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.
Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’
Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.
As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel.
In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’
Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of wisdom.
For this is the ultimate noble wisdom, namely,
the knowledge of the ending of suffering.
Their freedom, being founded on truth, is unshakable.
For that which is false has a deceptive nature, while that which is true has an undeceptive nature—extinguishment.
Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of truth.
For this is the ultimate noble truth, namely,
that which has an undeceptive nature—extinguishment.
In their ignorance, they used to acquire attachments.
Those have been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so they are unable to arise in the future.
Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of generosity.
For this is the ultimate noble generosity, namely,
letting go of all attachments.
In their ignorance, they used to be covetous, full of desire and lust.
That has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so it’s unable to arise in the future.
In their ignorance, they used to be contemptuous, full of ill will and malevolence.
That has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so it’s unable to arise in the future.
In their ignorance, they used to be ignorant, full of delusion.
That has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so it’s unable to arise in the future.
Therefore a mendicant thus endowed is endowed with the ultimate foundation of peace.
For this is the ultimate noble peace, namely,
the pacification of greed, hate, and delusion.
‘Don’t neglect wisdom, preserve truth, foster generosity, and train only for peace.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘They have four foundations, standing on which the streams of identification don’t flow. And when the streams of identification don’t flow, they’re called a sage at peace.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
These are all forms of identifying: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Identification is a disease, a boil, a dart.
Having gone beyond all identification, one is called a sage at peace.
The sage at peace is not reborn, does not grow old, and does not die. They are not shaken, and do not yearn.
For they have nothing which would cause them to be reborn. Not being reborn, how could they grow old? Not growing old, how could they die? Not dying, how could they be shaken? Not shaking, for what could they yearn?
‘They have four foundations, standing on which the streams of identification don’t flow. And when the streams of identification don’t flow, they’re called a sage at peace.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
Mendicant, you should remember this brief analysis of the six elements.”
Then Venerable Pukkusāti thought,
“It seems the Teacher has come to me! The Holy One has come to me! The fully awakened Buddha has come to me!” He got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to presume to address the Buddha as ‘reverend’.
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, mendicant, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”
“Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
“But mendicant, are your bowl and robes complete?”
“No, sir, they are not.”
“The Realized Ones do not ordain those whose bowl and robes are incomplete.”
And then Venerable Pukkusāti approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
But while he was wandering in search of a bowl and robes, a stray cow took his life.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, the gentleman named Pukkusāti, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?”
“Mendicants, Pukkusāti was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.
With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Vacchagotta on Fire
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, is this your view: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘The world is finite. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘The world is infinite. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘The soul and the body are the same thing. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘The soul and the body are different things. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘A Realized One exists after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Then is this your view: ‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
“That’s not my view, Vaccha.”
“Master Gotama, when asked these ten questions, you say: ‘That’s not my view.’
Seeing what drawback do you avoid all these convictions?”
“Each of these ten convictions is the thicket of views, the desert of views, the trick of views, the evasiveness of views, the fetter of views. They’re beset with anguish, distress, and fever. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
Seeing this drawback I avoid all these convictions.”
“But does Master Gotama have any convictions at all?”
“The Realized One has done away with convictions.
For the Realized One has seen:
‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.
Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.
Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’
That’s why the Realized One is freed with the ending, fading away, cessation, giving up, and letting go of all identifying, all worries, and all ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit, I say.”
“But Master Gotama, when a mendicant’s mind is freed like this, where are they reborn?”
“‘They’re reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”
“Well then, are they not reborn?”
“‘They’re not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”
“Well then, are they both reborn and not reborn?”
“‘They’re both reborn and not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”
“Well then, are they neither reborn nor not reborn?”
“‘They’re neither reborn nor not reborn’ doesn’t apply, Vaccha.”
“Master Gotama, when asked all these questions, you say: ‘It doesn’t apply.’
I fail to understand this point, Master Gotama; I’ve fallen into confusion.
And I’ve now lost even the degree of clarity I had from previous discussions with Master Gotama.”
“No wonder you don’t understand, Vaccha, no wonder you’re confused.
For this principle is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.
It’s hard for you to understand, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.
Well then, Vaccha, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, Vaccha?
Suppose a fire was burning in front of you. Would you know:
‘This fire is burning in front of me’?”
“Yes, I would, Master Gotama.”
“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:
‘This fire burning in front of you: what does it depend on to burn?’ How would you answer?”
“I would answer like this:
‘This fire burning in front of me burns in dependence on grass and logs as fuel.’”
“Suppose that fire burning in front of you was extinguished. Would you know:
‘This fire in front of me is extinguished’?”
“Yes, I would, Master Gotama.”
“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you:
‘This fire in front of you that is extinguished: in what direction did it go—
east, south, west, or north?’ How would you answer?”
“It doesn’t apply, Master Gotama. The fire depended on grass and logs as fuel. When that runs out, and no more fuel is added, the fire is reckoned to have become extinguished due to lack of fuel.”
“In the same way, Vaccha, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,
like the ocean.
‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.
Any feeling …
perception …
consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of consciousness. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom,
like the ocean.
‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.”
When he said this, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, suppose there was a large sal tree not far from a town or village.
And because it’s impermanent, its branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood would fall off.
After some time it would be rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, consisting purely of heartwood.
In the same way, Master Gotama’s dispensation is rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, consisting purely of heartwood.
Excellent, Master Gotama! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
At Sāmagāma
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans near the village of Sāma.
Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā.
With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words:
“You don’t understand this teaching and training.
I understand this teaching and training.
What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong.
I’m practicing right.
I stay on topic, you don’t.
You said last what you should have said first.
You said first what you should have said last.
What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”
You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics.
And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.
And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village.
He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
Ānanda said to him,
“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.
Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.
Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and Ānanda informed him of what Cunda had said.
He went on to say,
“Sir, it occurs to me:
‘When the Buddha has passed away, let no dispute arise in the Saṅgha.
For such a dispute would be for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.’”
“What do you think, Ānanda?
Do you see even two mendicants who disagree regarding the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is,
the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path?”
“No, sir, I do not.
Nevertheless, there are some individuals who appear to live obedient to the Buddha, but when the Buddha has passed away they might create a dispute in the Saṅgha regarding livelihood or the monastic code.
Such a dispute would be for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.”
“Ānanda, dispute about livelihood or the monastic code is a minor matter.
But should a dispute arise in the Saṅgha concerning the path or the practice, that would be for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.
Ānanda, there are these six roots of arguments.
Firstly, a mendicant is irritable and hostile.
Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.
They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.
If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.
If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.
That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.
Furthermore, a mendicant is offensive and contemptuous …
They’re jealous and stingy …
They’re devious and deceitful …
They have wicked desires and wrong view …
They’re attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.
Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.
They create a dispute in the Saṅgha, which is for the hurt and unhappiness of the people, for the harm, hurt, and suffering of gods and humans.
If you see such a root of arguments in yourselves or others, you should try to give up this bad thing.
If you don’t see it, you should practice so that it doesn’t come up in the future.
That’s how to give up this bad root of arguments, so it doesn’t come up in the future.
These are the six roots of arguments.
There are four kinds of disciplinary issues.
What four?
Disciplinary issues due to disputes, accusations, offenses, or proceedings.
These are the four kinds of disciplinary issues.
There are seven methods for the settlement of any disciplinary issues that might arise.
Removal in the presence of those concerned is applicable. Removal by accurate recollection is applicable. Removal due to recovery from madness is applicable. The offense should be acknowledged. The decision of a majority. A verdict of aggravated misconduct. Covering over with grass.
And how is there removal in the presence of those concerned?
It’s when mendicants are disputing: ‘This is the teaching,’ ‘This is not the teaching,’ ‘This is the training,’ ‘This is not the training.’
Those mendicants should all sit together in harmony
and thoroughly go over the guidelines of the teaching.
They should settle that disciplinary issue in agreement with the guidelines.
That’s how there is removal in the presence of those concerned.
And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by removal in the presence of those concerned.
And how is there the decision of a majority?
If those mendicants are not able to settle that issue in that monastery,
they should go to another monastery with more mendicants.
There they should all sit together in harmony
and thoroughly go over the guidelines of the teaching.
They should settle that disciplinary issue in agreement with the guidelines.
That’s how there is the decision of a majority. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by decision of a majority.
And how is there removal by accurate recollection?
It’s when mendicants accuse a mendicant of a serious offense; one entailing expulsion, or close to it:
‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’
‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’
The removal by accurate recollection is applicable to them.
That’s how there is the removal by accurate recollection. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by removal by accurate recollection.
And how is there removal by recovery from madness?
It’s when mendicants accuse a mendicant of the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion, or close to it:
‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’
‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’
But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:
‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’
‘Reverends, I had gone mad, I was out of my mind.
And while I was mad I did and said many things that are not proper for an ascetic.
I don’t remember any of that,
I was mad when I did it.’
The removal by recovery from madness is applicable to them.
That’s how there is the removal by recovery from madness. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by recovery from madness.
And how is there the acknowledging of an offense?
It’s when a mendicant, whether accused or not, recalls an offense and clarifies it and reveals it.
After approaching a more senior mendicant, that mendicant should arrange his robe over one shoulder, bow to that mendicant’s feet, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and say:
‘Sir, I have fallen into such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’
The senior mendicant says:
‘Do you see it?’
‘Yes, I see it.’
‘Then restrain yourself in future.’
‘I shall restrain myself.’
That’s how there is the acknowledging of an offense. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by acknowledging an offense.
And how is there a verdict of aggravated misconduct?
It’s when a mendicant accuses a mendicant of the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion, or close to it:
‘Venerable, do you recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it?’
‘No, reverends, I don’t recall committing such an offense.’
But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:
‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’
‘Reverends, I don’t recall committing a serious offense of that nature.
But I do recall committing a light offense.’
But though they try to get out of it, the mendicants pursue the issue:
‘Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’
‘Reverends, I’ll go so far as to acknowledge this light offense even when not asked.
Why wouldn’t I acknowledge a serious offense when asked?’
‘You wouldn’t have acknowledged that light offense without being asked, so why would you acknowledge a serious offense?
Surely the venerable must know perfectly well if you recall committing an offense that entails expulsion or close to it!’
‘Reverend, I do recall committing the kind of serious offense that entails expulsion or close to it.
I spoke too hastily when I said
that I didn’t recall it.’
That’s how there is a verdict of aggravated misconduct. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by a verdict of aggravated misconduct.
And how is there the covering over with grass?
It’s when the mendicants continually argue, quarrel, and fight, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.
Those mendicants should all sit together in harmony.
A competent mendicant of one party, having got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, and raised their joined palms, should inform the Saṅgha:
‘Sir, let the Saṅgha listen to me.
We have been continually arguing, quarreling, and fighting, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.
If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, then—for the benefit of these venerables and myself—I disclose in the middle of the Saṅgha by means of covering over with grass any offenses committed by these venerables and by myself, excepting only those that are gravely blameworthy and those connected with laypeople.’
Then a competent mendicant of the other party, having got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, and raising their joined palms, should inform the Saṅgha:
‘Sir, let the Saṅgha listen to me.
We have been continually arguing, quarreling, and fighting, doing and saying many things that are not proper for an ascetic.
If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, then—for the benefit of these venerables and myself—I disclose in the middle of the Saṅgha by means of covering over with grass any offenses committed by these venerables and by myself, excepting only those that are gravely blameworthy and those connected with laypeople.’
That’s how there is the covering over with grass. And that’s how certain disciplinary issues are settled, that is,
by covering over with grass.
Ānanda, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness, both in public and in private.
This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness …
This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness …
This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material possessions they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions.
This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
This too is a warm-hearted quality.
Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.
This too is a warm-hearted quality.
These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
If you should undertake and follow these six warm-hearted qualities, do you see any criticism, large or small, that you could not endure?”
“No, sir.”
“That’s why, Ānanda, you should undertake and follow these six warm-hearted qualities.
That will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.

One Fine Night
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“I shall teach you the passage for recitation and the analysis of One Fine Night.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Don’t run back to the past,
don’t hope for the future.
What’s past is left behind;
the future has not arrived;
and phenomena in the present
are clearly seen in every case.
Knowing this, foster it—
unfaltering, unshakable.
Today’s the day to keenly work—
who knows, tomorrow may bring death!
For there is no bargain to be struck
with Death and his mighty hordes.
The peaceful sage explained it’s those
who keenly meditate like this,
tireless all night and day,
who truly have that one fine night.
And how do you run back to the past?
You muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’
That’s how you run back to the past.
And how do you not run back to the past?
You don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘I had such form in the past.’ … ‘I had such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the past.’
That’s how you don’t run back to the past.
And how do you hope for the future?
You muster delight there, thinking: ‘May I have such form in the future.’ … ‘May I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future.’
That’s how you hope for the future.
And how do you not hope for the future?
You don’t muster delight there, thinking: ‘May I have such form in the future.’ … ‘May I have such feeling … perception … choice … consciousness in the future.’
That’s how you don’t hope for the future.
And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena?
It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They regard feeling …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
That’s how you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
And how do you not falter amid presently arisen phenomena?
It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They don’t regard feeling …
perception …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
That’s how you don’t falter amid presently arisen phenomena.

The Root of All Things
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the root of all things.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They perceive earth as earth.
But then they identify with earth, they identify regarding earth, they identify as earth, they identify that ‘earth is mine’, they take pleasure in earth.

Middle Discourses
With Assalāyana
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Sāvatthī on some business.
Then those brahmins thought,
“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.
Who is capable of having a dialogue with him about this?”
Now at that time the brahmin student Assalāyana was residing in Sāvatthī. He was young, newly tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.
Then those brahmins thought,
“This Assalāyana is capable of having a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about this.”
So they approached Assalāyana and said to him,
“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.
Please, Mister Assalāyana, have a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about this.”
When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,
“They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.
But speakers of principle are hard to have a dialogue with.
I’m not capable of having a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about this.”
For a second time, those brahmins said to him
“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.
Please, Mister Assalāyana, have a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about this.
For you have lived as a wanderer.”
And for a second time, Assalāyana refused.
For a third time, those brahmins said to him,
“This ascetic Gotama advocates purification for all four classes.
Please, Mister Assalāyana, have a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about this.
For you have lived as a wanderer.
Don’t admit defeat before going into battle!”
When they said this, Assalāyana said to them,
“Clearly, gentlemen, I’m not getting through to you when I say:
‘They say that the ascetic Gotama is a speaker of principle.
But speakers of principle are hard to have a dialogue with.
I’m not capable of having a dialogue with the ascetic Gotama about this.’
Nevertheless, I shall go at your bidding.”
Then Assalāyana together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, the brahmins say:
‘Only brahmins are the highest caste; other castes are inferior.
Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.
Only brahmins are purified, not others.
Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’
What do you say about this?”
“But Assalāyana, brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding.
Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say:
‘Only brahmins are the highest caste; other castes are inferior.
Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.
Only brahmins are purified, not others.
Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Have you heard that in Greece and Persia and other foreign lands there are only two classes, masters and bonded servants; and that masters may become servants, and servants masters?”
“Yes, I have heard that.”
“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ self-confidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose an aristocrat were to kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; to use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and to be covetous, malicious, with wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Would this happen only to an aristocrat, and not to a brahmin?
Or suppose a merchant,
or a worker were to act in the same way. Would that result befall only a merchant or a worker, and not to a brahmin?”
“No, Master Gotama.
If they acted the same way, the same result would befall an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker.
For if any of the four classes were to kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; to use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and to be covetous, malicious, with wrong view, then, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”
“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ self-confidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose a brahmin were to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct; from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and from covetousness, malice, and wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Would this happen only to an brahmin, and not to an aristocrat, a merchant, or a worker?”
“No, Master Gotama.
If they acted the same way, the same result would befall an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker.
For if any of the four classes were to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct; from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and from covetousness, malice, and wrong view, then, when their body breaks up, after death, they’d be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ self-confidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Is only a brahmin capable of developing a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will for this region, and not an aristocrat, merchant, or worker?”
“No, Master Gotama.
Aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers can all do so.
For all four classes are capable of developing a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will for this region.”
“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ self-confidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Is only a brahmin capable of taking some bathing paste of powdered shell, going to the river, and washing off dust and dirt, and not an aristocrat, merchant, or worker?”
“No, Master Gotama.
All four classes are capable of doing this.”
“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ self-confidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people born in different castes and say to them:
‘Please gentlemen, let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats, brahmins, or chieftains take a drill-stick made of teak, sal, frankincense wood, sandalwood, or cherry wood, light a fire and produce heat.
And let anyone here who was born in a family of outcastes, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors take a drill-stick made from a dog’s drinking trough, a pig’s trough, a dustbin, or castor-oil wood, light a fire and produce heat.’
What do you think, Assalāyana?
Would only the fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood have flames, color, and radiance, and be usable as fire,
and not the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality wood?”
“No, Master Gotama.
The fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood would have flames, color, and radiance, and be usable as fire,
and so would the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality wood.
For all fire has flames, color, and radiance, and is usable as fire.”
“Then what is the source of the brahmins’ self-confidence and forcefulness in this matter that they make this claim?”
“Even though you say this, still the brahmins maintain their belief.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl, and they had a child.
Would that child be called an aristocrat after the father or a brahmin after the mother?”
“They could be called either.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose a brahmin boy was to sleep with an aristocrat girl, and they had a child.
Would that child be called an aristocrat after the mother or a brahmin after the father?”
“They could be called either.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose a mare were to mate with a donkey, and she gave birth to a mule.
Would that mule be called a horse after the mother or a donkey after the father?”
“It’s a mule, as it is a crossbreed.
I see the difference in this case,
but not in the previous cases.”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers who had shared a womb. One was educated, a reciter, while the other was uneducated and not a reciter.
Who would the brahmins feed first at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?”
“They’d first feed the student who was educated, a reciter.
For how could an offering to someone who is uneducated and not a reciter be very fruitful?”
“What do you think, Assalāyana?
Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers who had shared a womb. One was educated, a reciter, but was unethical, of bad character, while the other was uneducated and not a reciter, but was ethical and of good character.
Who would the brahmins feed first?”
“They’d first feed the student who was uneducated and not a reciter, but was ethical and of good character.
For how could an offering to someone who is unethical and of bad character be very fruitful?”
“Firstly you relied on birth, Assalāyana,
then you switched to education,
then you switched to abstemious behavior.
Now you’ve come around to believing in purification for the four classes, just as I advocate.”
When he said this, Assalāyana sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
Knowing this, the Buddha said to him:
“Once upon a time, Assalāyana, seven brahmin hermits settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region. They had the following harmful misconception:
‘Only brahmins are the highest caste; other castes are inferior.
Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’
The hermit Devala the Dark heard about this.
So he did up his hair and beard, dressed in magenta robes, put on his boots, grasped a golden staff, and appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin hermits.
Then he wandered about the yard saying,
‘Where, oh where have those brahmin hermits gone?
Where, oh where have those brahmin hermits gone?’
Then those brahmin hermits said,
‘Who’s this wandering about our courtyard like a cowpoke?
Let’s curse him!’
So they cursed Devala the Dark,
‘Be ashes, lowlife!
Be ashes, lowlife!’
But the more the hermits cursed him, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely Devala the Dark became.
Then those brahmin hermits said,
‘Our austerities are in vain! Our spiritual path is fruitless!
For when we used to curse someone
to become ashes,
ashes they became.
But the more we curse this one, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely he becomes.’
‘Gentlemen, your austerities are not in vain; your spiritual path is not fruitless.
Please let go of your malevolence towards me.’
‘We let go of our malevolence towards you.
But who are you, sir?’
‘Have you heard of
the hermit Devala the Dark?’
‘Yes, sir.’
‘I am he, sirs.’
Then they approached Devala and bowed to him.
Devala said to them,
‘I heard that when the seven brahmin hermits had settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region, they had the following harmful misconception:
“Only brahmins are the highest caste; other castes are inferior.
Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.
Only brahmins are purified, not others.
Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.”’
‘That’s right, sir.’
‘But do you know
whether your birth mother only had relations with a brahmin and not with a non-brahmin?’
‘We don’t know that.’
‘But do you know
whether your birth mother’s mothers back to the seventh generation only had relations with brahmins and not with non-brahmins?’
‘We don’t know that.’
‘But do you know
whether your birth father only had relations with a brahmin woman and not with a non-brahmin?’
‘We don’t know that.’
‘But do you know
whether your birth father’s fathers back to the seventh generation only had relations with brahmins and not with non-brahmins?’
‘We don’t know that.’
‘But do you know
how an embryo is conceived?’
‘We do know that, sir.
An embryo is conceived when these three things come together—the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle, and the spirit being reborn is present.’
‘But do you know
for sure whether that spirit is an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker?’
‘We don’t know that.’
‘In that case, sirs, don’t you know
what you are?’
‘In that case, sir, we don’t know
what we are.’
So even those seven brahmin hermits were stumped when pursued, pressed, and grilled by the seer Devala on their own doctrine of ancestry.
So how could you succeed, being grilled by me now on your own doctrine of ancestry—you who have not even mastered your own teacher’s doctrine?”
When he had spoken, Assalāyana said to him,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
The Foolish and the Astute
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“These are the three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of a fool.
What three?
A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts poorly.
If a fool didn’t think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then how would the astute know of them,
‘This fellow is a fool, a bad person’?
But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then the astute do know of them,
‘This fellow is a fool, a bad person’.
A fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in the present life.
Suppose a fool is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,
where people are discussing what is proper and fitting.
And suppose that fool is someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
Then that fool thinks,
‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting.
But those things are found in me and I am seen in them!’
This is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present life.
Furthermore, a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—
whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.
Then that fool thinks,
‘The kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishments—
those things are found in me and I am seen in them!
If the kings find out about me, they will inflict the same kinds of punishments on me!’
This is the second kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present life.
Furthermore, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.
It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth.
In the same way, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.
Then that fool thinks,
‘Well, I haven’t done good and skillful things that keep me safe.
And I have done bad, violent, and depraved things.
When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’
They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breasts and falling into confusion.
This is the third kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in the present life.
Having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that
it is utterly unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable, it is of hell that this should be said.
So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how painful hell is.”
When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”
“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.
“Suppose they arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying,
‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’
The king would say,
‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’
The king’s men did as they were told.
Then at midday the king would say,
‘My men, how is that man?’
‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’
The king would say,
‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the midday with a hundred spears!’
The king’s men did as they were told.
Then late in the afternoon the king would say,
‘My men, how is that man?’
‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’
The king would say,
‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’
The king’s men did as they were told.
What do you think, mendicants?
Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears?”
“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!”
Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants,
“What do you think, mendicants?
Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”
“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.”
“In the same way, compared to the suffering in hell, the pain and distress experienced by that man due to being struck with three hundred spears doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.
The wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion.
They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest.
And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.
The wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. …
They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. …
They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …
They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. …
The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them into a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing.
There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round.
And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.
The wardens of hell toss them in the Great Hell.
Now, about that Great Hell:
‘Four are its corners, four its doors,
neatly divided in equal parts.
Surrounded by an iron wall,
of iron is its roof.
The ground is even made of iron,
it burns with fierce fire.
The heat forever radiates
a hundred leagues around.’
I could tell you many different things about hell.
So much so that it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in hell.
There are, mendicants, animals that feed on grass.
They eat by cropping fresh or dried grass with their teeth.
And what animals feed on grass?
Elephants, horses, cattle, donkeys, goats, deer, and various others.
A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on grass.
There are animals that feed on dung.
When they catch a whiff of dung they run to it, thinking,
‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’
It’s like when brahmins smell a burnt offering, they run to it, thinking,
‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’
In the same way, there are animals that feed on dung.
When they catch a whiff of dung they run to it, thinking,
‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’
And what animals feed on dung?
Chickens, pigs, dogs, jackals, and various others.
A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on dung.
There are animals who are born, live, and die in darkness.
And what animals are born, live, and die in darkness?
Moths, maggots, earthworms, and various others.
A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born, live, and die in darkness.
There are animals who are born, live, and die in water.
And what animals are born, live, and die in water?
Fish, turtles, crocodiles, and various others.
A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born, live, and die in water.
There are animals who are born, live, and die in filth.
And what animals are born, live, and die in filth?
Those animals that are born, live, and die in a rotten fish, a rotten corpse,
rotten porridge,
or a sewer.
A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who are born, live, and die in filth.
I could tell you many different things about the animal realm.
So much so that it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in the animal realm.
Mendicants, suppose a person were to throw a yoke with a single hole into the ocean.
The east wind wafts it west; the west wind wafts it east; the north wind wafts it south; and the south wind wafts it north.
And there was a one-eyed turtle who popped up once every hundred years.
What do you think, mendicants?
Would that one-eyed turtle still poke its neck through the hole in that yoke?”
Only after a very long time, sir, if ever.”
“That one-eyed turtle would poke its neck through the hole in that yoke sooner than a fool who has fallen to the underworld would be reborn as a human being, I say.
Why is that?
Because in that place there’s no principled or moral conduct, and no doing what is good and skillful.
There they just prey on each other, preying on the weak.
And suppose that fool, after a very long time, returned to the human realm.
They’d be reborn in a low class family—a family of outcastes, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors.
Such families are poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.
And they’d be ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
Suppose a gambler on the first unlucky throw were to lose his wife and child, all his property, and then get thrown in jail.
But such an unlucky throw is trivial compared to
the unlucky throw whereby a fool, having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
This is the total fulfillment of the fool’s level.
There are these three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of an astute person.
What three?
An astute person thinks well, speaks well, and acts well.
If an astute person didn’t think well, speak well, and act well, then how would the astute know of them,
‘This fellow is astute, a good person’?
But since an astute person does think well, speak well, and act well, then the astute do know of them,
‘This fellow is astute, a good person’.
An astute person experiences three kinds of pleasure and happiness in the present life.
Suppose an astute person is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad,
where people are discussing about what is proper and fitting.
And suppose that astute person is someone who refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
Then that astute person thinks,
‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting.
And those things are found in me and I am seen in them.’
This is the first kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in the present life.
Furthermore, an astute person sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—
whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.
Then that astute person thinks,
‘The kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishments—those things are not found in me and I am not seen in them!’
This is the second kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in the present life.
Furthermore, when an astute person is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past good deeds—good conduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.
It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth.
In the same way, when an astute person is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past good deeds—good conduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them.
Then that astute person thinks,
‘Well, I haven’t done bad, violent, and depraved things.
And I have done good and skillful deeds that keep me safe.
When I pass away, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’
So they don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
This is the third kind of pleasure and happiness that an astute person experiences in the present life.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that
it is utterly likable, desirable, and agreeable, it is of heaven that this should be said.
So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how pleasurable heaven is.”
When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”
“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.
“Suppose there was a king, a wheel-turning monarch who possessed seven treasures and four blessings, and experienced pleasure and happiness because of them.
What seven?
It’s when, on the fifteenth day sabbath, an anointed aristocratic king has bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath. And the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.
Seeing this, the king thinks,
‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch.
Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’
Then the anointed aristocratic king, taking a ceremonial vase in his left hand, besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying,
‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’
Then the wheel-treasure rolls towards the east.
And the king follows it together with his army of four divisions.
In whatever place the wheel-treasure stands still, there the king comes to stay together with his army.
And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter come to the wheel-turning monarch and say,
‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’
The wheel-turning monarch says,
‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’
And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter become his vassals.
Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolls towards the south. …
Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolls towards the west. …
Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolls towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions.
In whatever place the wheel-treasure stands still, there the king comes to stay together with his army.
And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter come to the wheel-turning monarch and say,
‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’
The wheel-turning monarch says,
‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’
And so the rulers of the northern quarter become his vassals.
And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returns to the royal capital. There it stands still at the gate to the royal compound as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound.
Such is the wheel-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
Next, the elephant-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, touching the ground in seven places, a king of elephants named Sabbath.
Seeing him, the king was impressed,
‘This would truly be a fine elephant vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’
Then the elephant-treasure submitted to taming, as if he were a fine thoroughbred elephant that had been tamed for a long time.
Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same elephant-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast.
Such is the elephant-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
Next, the horse-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, with head of black and mane like woven reeds, a royal steed named Thundercloud.
Seeing him, the king was impressed,
‘This would truly be a fine horse vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’
Then the horse-treasure submitted to taming, as if he were a fine thoroughbred horse that had been tamed for a long time.
Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same horse-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast.
Such is the horse-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
Next, the jewel-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
It is a beryl gem that’s naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked.
And the radiance of that jewel spreads all-round for a league.
Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same jewel-treasure, mobilized his army of four divisions and, with the jewel hoisted on his banner, set out in the dark of the night.
Then the villagers around them set off to work, thinking that it was day.
Such is the jewel-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
Next, the woman-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
She is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. She’s neither too tall nor too short; neither too thin nor too fat; neither too dark nor too light. She outdoes human beauty without reaching divine beauty.
And her touch is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok.
When it’s cool her limbs are warm, and when it’s warm her limbs are cool.
The fragrance of sandal floats from her body, and lotus from her mouth.
She gets up before the king and goes to bed after him, and is obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.
The woman-treasure does not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in deed.
Such is the woman-treasure who appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
Next, the householder-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
The power of clairvoyance manifests in him as a result of past deeds, by which he sees hidden treasure, both owned and ownerless.
He approaches the wheel-turning monarch and says,
‘Relax, sire.
I will take care of the treasury.’
Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same householder-treasure, boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the Ganges river. Then he said to the householder-treasure,
‘Householder, I need gold coins and bullion.’
‘Well then, great king, draw the boat up to one shore.’
‘It’s right here, householder, that I need gold coins and bullion.’
Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water, pulled up a pot full of gold coin and bullion, and said to the king,
‘Is this sufficient, great king? Has enough been done, great king, enough offered?’
The wheel-turning monarch said,
‘That is sufficient, householder.
Enough has been done, enough offered.’
Such is the householder-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
Next, the counselor-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
He is astute, competent, intelligent, and capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed, dismiss who should be dismissed, and retain who should be retained.
He approaches the wheel-turning monarch and says,
‘Relax, sire.
I shall issue instructions.’
Such is the counselor-treasure that appears to the wheel-turning monarch.
These are the seven treasures possessed by a wheel-turning monarch.
And what are the four blessings?
A wheel-turning monarch is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty, more so than other people.
This is the first blessing.
Furthermore, he is long-lived, more so than other people.
This is the second blessing.
Furthermore, he is rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other people.
This is the third blessing.
Furthermore, a wheel-turning monarch is as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders
as a father is to his children.
And the brahmins and householders are as dear to the wheel-turning monarch
as children are to their father.
Once it so happened that a wheel-turning monarch went with his army of four divisions to visit a park.
Then the brahmins and householders went up to him and said,
‘Slow down, Your Majesty, so we may see you longer!’
And the king addressed his charioteer,
‘Drive slowly, charioteer, so I can see the brahmins and householders longer!’
This is the fourth blessing.
These are the four blessings possessed by a wheel-turning monarch.
What do you think, mendicants?
Would a wheel-turning monarch who possessed these seven treasures and these four blessings experience pleasure and happiness because of them?”
“Sir, a wheel-turning monarch who possessed even a single one of these treasures would experience pleasure and happiness because of that, let alone all seven treasures and four blessings!”
Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants,
“What do you think, mendicants?
Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?”
“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.”
“In the same way, compared to the happiness of heaven, the pleasure and happiness experienced by a wheel-turning monarch due to those seven treasures and those four blessings doesn’t even count, it’s not even a fraction, there’s no comparison.
And suppose that astute person, after a very long time, returned to the human realm.
They’d be reborn in a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain.
And they’d be attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They’d get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and a bed, house, and lighting.
And they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
Suppose a gambler on the first lucky throw was to win a big pile of money.
But such a lucky throw is trivial compared to
the lucky throw whereby an astute person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
This is the total fulfillment of the astute person’s level.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Imported Cloth
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, for the day’s meditation.
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala mounted the Single Lotus Elephant and drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day.
He saw Ānanda coming off in the distance
and said to the minister Sirivaḍḍha,
“My dear Sirivaḍḍha, isn’t that Venerable Ānanda?”
“Indeed it is, great king.”
Then King Pasenadi addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala bows with his head at your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, if you have no urgent business, please wait a moment out of compassion.’”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied.
He did as the king asked.
Ānanda consented in silence.
Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot.
He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,
“Sir, if you have no urgent business, it would be nice of you to go to the bank of the Aciravatī river out of compassion.”
Ānanda consented in silence.
He went to the river bank and sat at the root of a certain tree on a seat spread out.
Then King Pasenadi rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Ānanda on foot.
He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Ānanda,
“Here, Venerable Ānanda, sit on this elephant rug.”
“Enough, great king,
you sit on it.
I’m sitting on my own seat.”
So the king sat down on the seat spread out,
“Sir, might the Buddha engage in the sort of behavior—by way of body, speech, or mind—that is faulted by ascetics and brahmins?”
“No, great king, the Buddha would not engage in the sort of behavior that is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
For I couldn’t fully express the question, but Ānanda’s answer completed it for me.
I don’t believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by incompetent fools, without examining or scrutinizing, is the most important thing.
Rather, I believe that praise or criticism of others spoken by competent and intelligent people after examining and scrutinizing is the most important thing.
But sir, what kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”
“Unskillful behavior.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior is unskillful?”
“Blameworthy behavior.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior is blameworthy?”
“Hurtful behavior.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior is hurtful?”
“Behavior that results in suffering.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior results in suffering?”
“Bodily behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,
and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.
That kind of bodily behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”
“But what kind of verbal behavior …
mental behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?” …
“Mental behavior that leads to hurting yourself, hurting others, and hurting both,
and which makes unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline.
That kind of mental behavior is faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”
“Sir, does the Buddha praise giving up all these unskillful things?”
“Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”
“But sir, what kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?”
“Skillful behavior.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior is skillful?”
“Blameless behavior.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior is blameless?”
“Pleasing behavior.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior is pleasing?”
“Behavior that results in happiness.”
“But what kind of bodily behavior results in happiness?”
“Bodily behavior that leads to pleasing yourself, pleasing others, and pleasing both,
and which makes unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.
That kind of bodily behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”
“But what kind of verbal behavior …
mental behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins?” …
“Mental behavior that leads to pleasing yourself, pleasing others, and pleasing both,
and which makes unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow.
That kind of mental behavior is not faulted by sensible ascetics and brahmins.”
“Sir, does the Buddha praise embracing all these skillful things?”
“Great king, the Realized One has given up all unskillful things and possesses skillful things.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How well this was said by Venerable Ānanda!
I’m delighted and satisfied with what you’ve expressed so well.
So much so that
if an elephant-treasure was suitable for you, I would give you one.
If a horse-treasure was suitable for you, I would give you one.
If a prize village was suitable for you, I would give you one.
But, sir, I know that
these things are not suitable for you.
This imported cloth was sent to me by King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha packed in a parasol case. It’s exactly sixteen measures long and eight wide.
May Venerable Ānanda please accept it out of compassion.”
“Enough, great king. My three robes are complete.”
“Sir, we have both seen this river Aciravatī
when it has rained heavily in the mountains, and the river overflows both its banks.
In the same way, Venerable Ānanda can make a set of three robes for himself from this imported cloak.
And you can share your old robes with your fellow monks.
In this way my religious donation will come to overflow, it seems to me.
Please accept the imported cloth.”
So Ānanda accepted it.
Then King Pasenadi said to him,
“Well, now, sir, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.”
“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”
Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what Ānanda said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Ānanda, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Soon after he left, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and told him what had happened.
He presented the cloth to the Buddha.
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Mendicants, King Pasenadi is lucky, so very lucky,
to get to see Ānanda and pay homage to him.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Prince Bodhi
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
Now at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.
Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sañjikāputta,
“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
And then ask him whether he
might accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the mendicant Saṅgha.”
“Yes, sir,” Sañjikāputta replied. He did as Prince Bodhi asked, and
the Buddha consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañjikāputta got up from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and said,
“I gave the ascetic Gotama your message,
and he accepted.”
And when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he said to Sañjikāputta,
“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and announce the time, saying,
‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’”
“Yes, sir,” Sañjikāputta replied, and he did as he was asked.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home.
Now at that time Prince Bodhi was standing outside the gates waiting for the Buddha.
Seeing the Buddha coming off in the distance,
he went out to greet him. After bowing and inviting the Buddha to go first, he approached the Pink Lotus longhouse.
But the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircase.
Then Prince Bodhi said to him,
“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!
It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”
But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent.
For a second time …
and a third time, Prince Bodhi said to him,
“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth!
It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”
Then the Buddha glanced at Venerable Ānanda.
So Ānanda said to Prince Bodhi,
“Fold up the cloth, Prince.
The Buddha will not step upon white cloth.
The Realized One has compassion for future generations.”
So Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouse.
Then the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.
Then Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat to one side,
and said to him,
“Sir, this is what I think:
‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’”
“Prince, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought:
‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’
Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,
‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’
Āḷāra Kālāma replied,
‘Stay, venerable.
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teacher’s doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved it.’
I quickly memorized that teaching.
So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”
Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’
So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,
‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’
When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,
and wisdom; I too have these things.
Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.
So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,
‘Reverend Kālāma, have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point, and declare having achieved it?’
‘I have, reverend.’
‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’
‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!
So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it.
The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.
So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know.
I am like you and you are like me.
Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’
And that is how my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his student, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.
I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him,
‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’
Uddaka replied,
‘Stay, venerable.
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teacher’s doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved it.’
I quickly memorized that teaching.
So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”
Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’
So I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him,
‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’
When I said this, Uddaka, son of Rāma, declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,
and wisdom; I too have these things.
Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.
So I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him,
‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’
‘He had, reverend.’
‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’
‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!
So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you've realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it.
The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.
So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.
Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.
Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’
And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka, son of Rāma, placed me in the position of a teacher, and honored me with lofty praise.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.
I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā.
There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to go for alms.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to go for alms.
This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation.’
So I sat down right there, thinking,
‘This is good enough for meditation.’
And then these three examples, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.
Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water.
Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking
to light a fire and produce heat.
What do you think, Prince?
By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”
Why is that?
Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water.
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”
“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.
This was the first example that occurred to me.
Then a second example occurred to me.
Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.
Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking
to light a fire and produce heat.
What do you think, Prince?
By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”
Why is that?
Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water.
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”
“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. But they haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.
This was the second example that occurred to me.
Then a third example occurred to me.
Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water.
Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking
to light a fire and produce heat.
What do you think, Prince?
By drilling the stick against that dried up, withered log on dry land far from water, could they light a fire and produce heat?”
“Yes, sir.
Why is that?
Because it’s a dried up, withered log, and it’s lying on dry land far from water.”
“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. And they have internally given up and stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are capable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening.
This was the third example that occurred to me.
These are the three examples, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, that occurred to me.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and torture mind with mind.’
So that’s what I did,
until sweat ran from my armpits.
It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and tortures them.
In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose.
But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise,
like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.
But then strong winds ground my head,
like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.
But then I got a severe headache,
like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.
But then strong winds carved up my belly,
like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears.
But then there was an intense burning in my body,
like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving.
Then some deities saw me and said,
‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’
Others said,
‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’
Others said,
‘He’s not dead or dying.
The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’
But deities came to me and said,
‘Good sir, don’t practice totally cutting off food.
If you do, we’ll infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’
So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a cup of broth made from mung beans, lentils, chickpeas, or green gram.’
So that’s what I did,
until my body became extremely emaciated.
Due to eating so little, my limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a corpse,
my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,
my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,
and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.
Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.
Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.
Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.
Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.
Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.
Then some people saw me and said, ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’
Some said, ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’
Some said, ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’
That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this.
But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, gruelling work.
Could there be another path to awakening?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of the rose-apple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Could that be the path to awakening?’
Stemming from that memory came the realization:
‘*That* is the path to awakening!’
Then it occurred to me,
‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated.
Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’
So I ate some solid food.
Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking,
‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’
But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying,
‘The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent; he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.’
After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption …
second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.
I recollected many past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When it was freed, I knew it was freed.
I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’
This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.
But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it.
It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.
It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’
And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:
‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,
enough with trying to explain it!
This teaching is not easily understood
by those mired in greed and hate.
Those caught up in greed can’t see
what’s subtle, going against the stream,
deep, hard to see, and very fine,
for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’
And as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, thought,
‘Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’
Then Brahmā Sahampati, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward me, and said,
‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.
There will be those who understand the teaching!’
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he went on to say:
‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past
an impure teaching thought up by those still stained.
Fling open the door to the deathless!
Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered.
Standing high on a rocky mountain,
you can see the people all around.
In just the same way, all-seer, wise one,
having ascended the Temple of Truth,
rid of sorrow, look upon the people
swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age.
Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,
wander the world without obligation.
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!
There will be those who understand!’
Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings.
And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.
Then I replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati:
‘Flung open are the doors to the deathless!
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith.
Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach
the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.’
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there.
Then it occurred to me,
‘Who should I teach first of all?
Who will quickly understand the teaching?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.
Why don’t I teach him first of all?
He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’
But a deity came to me and said,
‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’
And knowledge and vision arose in me,
‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma.
If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘Who should I teach first of all?
Who will quickly understand the teaching?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘That Uddaka, son of Rāma, is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.
Why don’t I teach him first of all?
He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’
But a deity came to me and said,
‘Sir, Uddaka, son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’
And knowledge and vision arose in me,
‘Uddaka, son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘This is a great loss for Uddaka.
If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘Who should I teach first of all?
Who will quickly understand the teaching?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving.
Why don’t I teach them first of all?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I wished, I set out for Benares.
While I was traveling along the road between Gaya and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me
‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.
In whose name have you gone forth, reverend?
Who is your Teacher?
Whose teaching do you believe in?’
I replied to Upaka in verse:
‘I am the champion, the knower of all,
unsullied in the midst of all things.
I’ve given up all, freed in the ending of craving.
Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?
I have no teacher.
There is no-one like me.
In the world with its gods,
I have no counterpart.
For in this world, I am the perfected one;
I am the supreme Teacher.
I alone am fully awakened,
cooled, extinguished.
I am going to the city of Kāsi
to roll forth the Wheel of Dhamma.
In this world that is so blind,
I’ll beat the deathless drum!’
‘According to what you claim, reverend, you ought to be the Infinite Victor.’
‘The victors are those who, like me,
have reached the ending of defilements.
I have conquered bad qualities, Upaka—
that’s why I’m a victor.’
When I had spoken, Upaka said: ‘If you say so, reverend.’ Shaking his head, he took a wrong turn and left.
Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Benares, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.
The group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distance
and stopped each other, saying,
‘Here comes the ascetic Gotama. He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.
We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe.
But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’
Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed.
Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet.
But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.
So I said to them,
‘Mendicants, don’t address me by name and as “reverend”.
The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved the Deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
But they said to me,
‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgence?’
So I said to them,
‘The Realized One has not become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and fallen into indulgence.
The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved the Deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
But for a second time they said to me,
‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve fallen into indulgence.’
So for a second time I said to them,
‘The Realized One has not become indulgent …’
But for a third time they said to me,
‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve fallen into indulgence.’
So I said to them,
‘Mendicants, have you ever known me to speak like this before?’
‘No, sir.’
‘The Realized One is Perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved the Deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
I was able to persuade the group of five mendicants.
Then sometimes I advised two mendicants, while the other three went for alms.
Then those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.
Sometimes I advised three mendicants, while the other two went for alms.
Then those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.
As the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this, they soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”
When he had spoken, Prince Bodhi said to the Buddha,
“Sir, when a mendicant has the Realized One as trainer, how long would it take for them to realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life?”
“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, prince?
Are you skilled in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, prince?
Suppose a man were to come along thinking,
‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant.
I’ll train in that art under him.’
If he’s faithless,
he wouldn’t achieve what he could with faith.
If he’s unhealthy,
he wouldn’t achieve what he could with good health.
If he’s devious or deceitful,
he wouldn’t achieve what he could with honesty and integrity.
If he’s lazy,
he wouldn’t achieve what he could with energy.
If he’s stupid,
he wouldn’t achieve what he could with wisdom.
What do you think, prince?
Could that man still train under you in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”
“Sir, if he had even a single one of these factors he couldn’t train under me, let alone all five.”
“What do you think, prince?
Suppose a man were to come along thinking,
‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant.
I’ll train in that art under him.’
If he’s faithful,
he’d achieve what he could with faith.
If he’s healthy,
he’d achieve what he could with good health.
If he’s honest and has integrity,
he’d achieve what he could with honesty and integrity.
If he’s energetic,
he’d achieve what he could with energy.
If he’s wise,
he’d achieve what he could with wisdom.
What do you think, prince?
Could that man still train under you in the art of wielding a hooked goad while riding an elephant?”
“Sir, if he had even a single one of these factors he could train under me, let alone all five.”
“In the same way, prince, there are these five factors that support meditation.
What five?
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.
They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
These are the five factors that support meditation.
When a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could
realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven years.
Let alone seven years,
they could
realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in six years,
or as little as one year.
Let alone one year,
when a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could
realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in seven months,
or as little as one day.
Let alone one day,
when a mendicant with these five factors that support meditation has the Realized One as trainer, they could be instructed in the evening and achieve distinction in the morning, or be instructed in the morning and achieve distinction in the evening.”
When he had spoken, Prince Bodhi said to the Buddha,
“Oh, the Buddha! Oh, the teaching! Oh, how well explained is the teaching!
For someone could be instructed in the evening and achieve distinction in the morning, or be instructed in the morning and achieve distinction in the evening.”
When he said this, Sañjikāputta said to Prince Bodhi,
“Though Master Bodhi speaks like this,
you don’t go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.”
“Don’t say that, dear Sañjikāputta, don’t say that!
I have heard and learned this in the presence of the lady, my mother.
This one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Then my pregnant mother went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
‘Sir, the prince or princess in my womb goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember them as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.’
Another time the Buddha was staying here in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
Then my nurse, carrying me on her hip, went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
‘Sir, this Prince Bodhi goes for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember him as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.’
Now for a third time I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
Mahākaccāna and One Fine Night
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery.
Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe.
When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, stood to one side, and said to Samiddhi:
“Mendicant, do you remember the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night?”
“No, reverend, I do not.
“I also do not.
But do you remember just the verses on One Fine Night?”
“I do not.
“I also do not.
Learn the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night, mendicant,
memorize it,
and remember it.
It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”
That’s what that deity said,
before vanishing right there.
Then, when the night had passed, Samiddhi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
Then he added:
“Sir, please teach me the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine night.”
“Well then, mendicant, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Samiddhi replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Don’t run back to the past,
don’t hope for the future.
What’s past is left behind;
the future has not arrived;
and phenomena in the present
are clearly seen in every case.
Knowing this, foster it—
unfaltering, unshakable.
Today’s the day to keenly work—
who knows, tomorrow may bring death!
For there is no bargain to be struck
with Death and his mighty hordes.
The peaceful sage explained it’s those
who keenly meditate like this,
tireless all night and day,
who truly have that one fine night.”
That is what the Buddha said.
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha?”
Then those mendicants thought:
“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”
Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.
They told him what had happened, and said:
“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”
“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.
Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you passed him by, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.
Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”
“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:
“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
‘Don’t run back to the past …
not slacking off by night or day,
who truly have that one fine night.’
And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
And how do you run back to the past?
Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such eyes and such sights.’
So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.
Consciousness gets tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such ears and such sounds …
such a nose and such smells …
such a tongue and such tastes …
such a body and such touches …
such a mind and such thoughts.’
So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you run back to the past.
That’s how you run back to the past.
And how do you not run back to the past?
Consciousness doesn’t get tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such eyes and such sights.’
So you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer run back to the past.
Consciousness doesn’t get tied up there with desire and lust, thinking: ‘In the past I had such ears and such sounds …
such a nose and such smells …
such a tongue and such tastes …
such a body and such touches …
such a mind and such thoughts.’
So you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer run back to the past.
That’s how you don’t run back to the past.
And how do you hope for the future?
The heart is set on getting what it does not have, thinking: ‘May I have such eyes and such sights in the future.’
So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you hope for the future.
The heart is set on getting what it does not have, thinking: ‘May I have such ears and such sounds …
such a nose and such smells …
such a tongue and such tastes …
such a body and such touches …
such a mind and such thoughts in the future.’
So you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you hope for the future.
That’s how you hope for the future.
And how do you not hope for the future?
The heart is not set on getting what it does not have, thinking: ‘May I have such eyes and such sights in the future.’
So you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer hope for the future.
The heart is not set on getting what it does not have, thinking: ‘May I have such ears and such sounds …
such a nose and such smells …
such a tongue and such tastes …
such a body and such touches …
such a mind and such thoughts in the future.’
So you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer hope for the future.
That’s how you don’t hope for the future.
And how do you falter amid presently arisen phenomena?
Both the eye and sights
are presently arisen.
If consciousness gets tied up there in the present with desire and lust, you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
Both the ear and sounds …
nose and smells …
tongue and tastes …
body and touches …
mind and thoughts
are presently arisen.
If consciousness gets tied up there in the present with desire and lust, you take pleasure in that, and that’s when you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
That’s how you falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
And how do you not falter amid presently arisen phenomena?
Both the eye and sights
are presently arisen.
If consciousness doesn’t get tied up there in the present with desire and lust, you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
Both the ear and sounds …
nose and smells …
tongue and tastes …
body and touches …
mind and thoughts
are presently arisen.
If consciousness doesn’t get tied up there in the present with desire and lust, you don’t take pleasure in that, and that’s when you no longer falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
That’s how you don’t falter amid presently arisen phenomena.
This is how I understand the detailed meaning of that brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Yes, reverend,” said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said.
Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding:
“Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”
“Mahākaccāna is astute, mendicants, he has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
And then Sakka, lord of gods, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?”
“Lord of Gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard:
‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’
When a mendicant has heard that
nothing is worth insisting on,
they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—
they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.
Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.”
Then Sakka, lord of gods, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.
Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha.
He thought,
“Did that spirit comprehend what the Buddha said when he agreed with him, or not?
Why don’t I find out?”
And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Monastery and reappeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three.
Now at that time Sakka was amusing himself in the Single Lotus Park, supplied and provided with a divine orchestra.
Seeing Mahāmoggallāna coming off in the distance,
he dismissed the orchestra, approached Mahāmoggallāna, and said,
“Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, good sir!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.”
Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the seat spread out,
while Sakka took a low seat and sat to one side.
Mahāmoggallāna said to him,
“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?
Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”
“My good Moggallāna, I have many duties, and much to do,
not only for myself, but also for the Gods of the Thirty-Three.
Besides, I quickly forget even things I’ve properly heard, learned, attended, and memorized.
Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.
When I returned from that battle as a conqueror, I created the Palace of Victory.
The Palace of Victory has a hundred towers.
Each tower has seven hundred chambers.
Each chamber has seven nymphs.
Each nymph has seven maids.
Would you like to see the lovely Palace of Victory?”
Mahāmoggallāna consented in silence.
Then, putting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna in front, Sakka, lord of gods, and Vessavaṇa, the Great King, went to the Palace of Victory.
When they saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, Sakka’s maids,
being prudent and discreet, each went to her own bedroom.
They were just like a daughter-in-law who is prudent and discreet when they see their father-in-law.
Then Sakka and Vessavaṇa encouraged Moggallāna to wander and explore the palace, saying,
“See, in the palace, my good Moggallāna, this lovely thing!
And that lovely thing!”
“That looks nice for Venerable Kosiya, just like for someone who has made merit in the past.
Humans, when they see something lovely, also say:
‘It looks nice enough for the Gods of the Thirty-Three!’
That looks nice for Venerable Kosiya, just like for someone who has made merit in the past.”
Then Moggallāna thought,
“This spirit lives much too negligently.
Why don’t I stir up a sense of urgency in him?”
Then Moggallāna used his psychic power to make the Palace of Victory shake and rock and tremble with his big toe.
Then Sakka, Vessavaṇa, and the Gods of the Thirty-Three, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
The ascetic has such power and might that he makes the god’s home shake and rock and tremble with his big toe!”
Knowing that Sakka was shocked and awestruck, Moggallāna said to him,
“Kosiya, how did the Buddha briefly explain freedom through the ending of craving?
Please share this talk with me so that I can also get to hear it.”
“My dear Moggallāna, I approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
‘Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed with the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?’
When I had spoken the Buddha said to me:
‘Lord of Gods, it’s when a mendicant has heard:
“Nothing is worth insisting on”
When a mendicant has heard that
nothing is worth insisting on,
they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—
they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings.
Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”
That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.’
That’s how the Buddha briefly explained freedom through the ending of craving to me.”
Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Sakka said. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from among the Gods of the Thirty-Three and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery.
Soon after Moggallāna left, Sakka’s maids said to him,
“Good sir, was that the Blessed One, your Teacher?”
“No, it was not.
That was my spiritual companion Venerable Mahāmoggallāna.”
“You’re fortunate, good sir, so very fortunate,
to have a spiritual companion of such power and might!
We can’t believe that’s not the Blessed One, your Teacher!”
Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, do you recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to a certain well-known and illustrious spirit?”
“I do, Moggallāna.” And the Buddha retold all that happened when Sakka came to visit him, adding:
“That’s how I recall briefly explaining freedom through the ending of craving to Sakka, lord of gods.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Analysis of the Six Sense Fields
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of the six sense fields.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“‘The six interior sense fields should be understood. The six exterior sense fields should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood. The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood. Therein, relying on this, give up that. The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group. Of all meditation teachers, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those who wish to train.’
This is the recitation passage for the analysis of the six sense fields.
‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are the sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are the sense fields of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.
‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness.
‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There is contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
Hearing a sound with the ear …
Smelling an odor with the nose …
Tasting a flavor with the tongue …
Feeling a touch with the body …
Becoming conscious of a thought with the mind, one is preoccupied with a thought that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity.
So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity. ‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are six kinds of lay happiness and six kinds of renunciate happiness. There are six kinds of lay sadness and six kinds of renunciate sadness. There are six kinds of lay equanimity and six kinds of renunciate equanimity.
And in this context what are the six kinds of lay happiness?
There are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the world’s material delights. Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly obtained that have passed, ceased, and perished.
Such happiness is called lay happiness.
There are sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body …
Thoughts known by the mind that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the world’s material delights. Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such thoughts, or when you recollect thoughts you formerly obtained that have passed, ceased, and perished.
Such happiness is called lay happiness.
These are the six kinds of lay happiness.
And in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate happiness?
When you’ve understood the impermanence of sights—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—happiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
Such happiness is called renunciate happiness.
When you’ve understood the impermanence of sounds …
thoughts—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—happiness arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those thoughts are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
Such happiness is called renunciate happiness.
These are the six kinds of renunciate happiness.
And in this context what are the six kinds of lay sadness?
There are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the world’s material delights. Sadness arises when you regard it as a loss to lose such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly lost that have passed, ceased, and perished.
There are sounds known by the ear …
There are smells known by the nose …
There are tastes known by the tongue …
There are touches known by the body …
There are thoughts known by the mind that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the world’s material delights. Sadness arises when you regard it as a loss to lose such thoughts, or when you recollect thoughts you formerly lost that have passed, ceased, and perished.
Such sadness is called lay sadness.
These are the six kinds of lay sadness.
And in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate sadness?
When you’ve understood the impermanence of sights—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Upon seeing this, you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations:
‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’ When you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations like this, sadness arises because of the yearning.
Such sadness is called renunciate sadness.
When you’ve understood the impermanence of sounds …
thoughts—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those thoughts are impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Upon seeing this, you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations:
‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’ When you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations like this, sadness arises because of the yearning.
Such sadness is called renunciate sadness.
These are the six kinds of renunciate sadness.
And in this context what are the six kinds of lay equanimity?
When seeing a sight with the eye, equanimity arises for the uneducated ordinary person—a foolish ordinary person who has not overcome their limitations and the results of deeds, and is blind to the drawbacks.
Such equanimity does not transcend the sight.
That’s why it’s called lay equanimity.
When hearing a sound with the ear …
When smelling an odor with the nose …
When tasting a flavor with the tongue …
When feeling a touch with the body …
When knowing a thought with the mind, equanimity arises for the uneducated ordinary person—a foolish ordinary person who has not overcome their limitations and the results of deeds, and is blind to the drawbacks.
Such equanimity does not transcend the thought.
That’s why it’s called lay equanimity.
These are the six kinds of lay equanimity.
And in this context what are the six kinds of renunciate equanimity?
When you’ve understood the impermanence of sights—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—equanimity arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those sights are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
Such equanimity transcends the sight.
That’s why it’s called renunciate equanimity.
When you’ve understood the impermanence of sounds …
thoughts—their perishing, fading away, and cessation—equanimity arises as you truly understand through right understanding that both formerly and now all those thoughts are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
Such equanimity transcends the thought.
That’s why it’s called renunciate equanimity.
These are the six kinds of renunciate equanimity.
‘The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Therein, relying on this, give up that.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
Therein, by relying and depending on the six kinds of renunciate happiness, give up and go beyond the six kinds of lay happiness.
That’s how they are given up.
Therein, by relying on the six kinds of renunciate sadness, give up the six kinds of lay sadness.
That’s how they are given up.
Therein, by relying on the six kinds of renunciate equanimity, give up the six kinds of lay equanimity.
That’s how they are given up.
Therein, by relying on the six kinds of renunciate happiness, give up the six kinds of renunciate sadness.
That’s how they are given up.
Therein, by relying on the six kinds of renunciate equanimity, give up the six kinds of renunciate happiness.
That’s how they are given up.
There is equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and equanimity that is unified, based on unity.
And what is equanimity based on diversity?
There is equanimity towards sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches.
This is equanimity based on diversity.
And what is equanimity based on unity?
There is equanimity based on the dimensions of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception.
This is equanimity based on unity.
Therein, relying on equanimity based on unity, give up equanimity based on diversity.
That’s how it is given up.
Relying on non-identification, give up equanimity based on unity.
That’s how it is given up.
‘Therein, relying on this, give up that.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group.’
That’s what I said,
but why did I say it?
The first case is when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion:
‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’
But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.
In this case the Realized One is not displeased, he does not feel displeasure. He remains unaffected, mindful and aware.
This is the first case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness.
The next case is when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion:
‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’
And some of their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.
But some of their disciples do want to listen. They pay attention and apply their minds to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.
In this case the Realized One is not displeased,
nor is he pleased.
Rejecting both displeasure and pleasure, he remains equanimous, mindful and aware.
This is the second case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness.
The next case is when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion:
‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’
And their disciples want to listen. They pay attention and apply their minds to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the Teacher’s instruction.
In this case the Realized One is not pleased, he does not feel pleasure. He remains unaffected, mindful and aware.
This is the third case in which the Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness.
‘The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Of all meditation teachers, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those who wish to train.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
Driven by an elephant trainer, an elephant in training proceeds in just one direction:
east, west, north, or south.
Driven by a horse trainer, a horse in training proceeds in just one direction:
east, west, north, or south.
Driven by an ox trainer, an ox in training proceeds in just one direction:
east, west, north, or south.
But driven by the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, a person in training proceeds in eight directions:
Having physical form, they see visions.
This is the first direction.
Not perceiving physical form internally, they see visions externally.
This is the second direction.
They’re focused only on beauty.
This is the third direction.
Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.
This is the fourth direction.
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
This is the fifth direction.
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.
This is the sixth direction.
Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is the seventh direction.
Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.
This is the eighth direction.
Driven by the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, a person in training proceeds in these eight directions.
‘Of all meditation teachers, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those who wish to train.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
At Isigili
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Isigili Mountain.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, do you see that Mount Vebhāra?”
“Yes, sir.”
“It used to have a different label and description.
Do you see that Mount Paṇḍava?”
“Yes, sir.”
“It too used to have a different label and description.
Do you see that Mount Vepulla?”
“Yes, sir.”
“It too used to have a different label and description.
Do you see that Mount Vulture’s Peak?”
“Yes, sir.”
“It too used to have a different label and description.
Do you see that Mount Isigili?”
“Yes, sir.”
“It used to have exactly the same label and description.
Once upon a time, five hundred Buddhas awakened for themselves dwelt for a long time on this Isigili.
They were seen entering the mountain, but after entering were seen no more.
When people noticed this they said:
‘That mountain swallows these hermits!’
That’s how it came to be known as Isigili.
I shall declare the names of the Buddhas awakened for themselves;
I shall extol the names of the Buddhas awakened for themselves;
I shall teach the names of the Buddhas awakened for themselves.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“The Buddhas awakened for themselves who dwelt for a long time on this Isigili were named Ariṭṭha,
Upariṭṭha,
Tagarasikhin,
Sudassana,
Piyadassin,
and Bhāvitatta.
Those saintly beings, untroubled and free of hope,
who each achieved awakening by themselves;

Middle Discourses
Shrines to the Teaching
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Medeḷumpa.
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Townsville on some business.
Then he addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,
“My good Kārāyana, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,
“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.
Please go at your convenience.”
Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Townsville,
heading for the park grounds.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the park on foot.
As he was going for a walk in the park he saw roots of trees that were impressive and inspiring, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.
The sight reminded him right away of the Buddha:
“These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.”
He addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,
“These roots of trees, so impressive and inspiring, are like those where we used to pay homage to the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
My good Kārāyana, where is that Buddha at present?”
“Great king, there is a Sakyan town named Medaḷumpa.
That’s where the Buddha is now staying.”
“But how far away is that town?”
“Not far, great king,
it’s three leagues.
We can get there while it’s still light.”
“Well then, harness the chariots, and we shall go to see the Buddha.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Dīgha Kārāyana. He harnessed the chariots and informed the king,
“Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed.
Please go at your convenience.”
Then King Pasenadi mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Townsville to Medaḷumpa.
He reached the town while it was still light
and headed for the park grounds.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot.
At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.
King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said,
“Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?
For I want to see him.”
“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed.
Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock with the latch.
The Buddha will open the door.”
The king right away presented his sword and turban to Dīgha Kārāyana,
who thought,
“Now the king seeks privacy. I should wait here.”
Then the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door.
King Pasenadi entered the dwelling, and bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
“Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!
I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”
“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?”
“Sir, I infer about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
It happens, sir, that I see some ascetics and brahmins leading the spiritual life only for a limited period: ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years.
Some time later—nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed—they amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
But here I see the mendicants leading the spiritual life entirely full and pure as long as they live, to their last breath.
I don’t see any other spiritual life elsewhere so full and pure.
That’s why I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.
But here I see the mendicants living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.
I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so harmonious.
So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, I have walked and wandered from monastery to monastery and from park to park.
There I’ve seen some ascetics and brahmins who are thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight, you’d think.
It occurred to me:
‘Clearly these venerables lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, or they’re hiding some bad deed they’ve done.
That’s why they’re thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight, you’d think.’
I went up to them and said:
‘Venerables, why are you so thin, haggard, pale, and veiny—hardly a captivating sight, you’d think?’
‘We have jaundice, great king.’
But here I see mendicants always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.
It occurred to me:
‘Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.
That’s why these venerables are always smiling and joyful, obviously happy, with cheerful faces, living relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.’
So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, as an anointed aristocratic king
I am able to execute, fine, or banish those who are guilty.
Yet when I’m sitting in judgment they interrupt me.
And I can’t get them
to stop interrupting me and wait until I’ve finished speaking.
But here I’ve seen the mendicants
while the Buddha is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, and there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.
Once it so happened that the Buddha was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.
Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.
And one of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee, to indicate:
‘Hush, venerable, don’t make a sound! Our teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching!’
It occurred to me:
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing,
how an assembly can be so well trained without rod or sword!’
I don’t see any other assembly elsewhere so well trained.
So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, I’ve seen some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters.
You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect.
They hear:
‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’
They formulate a question, thinking:
‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question.
If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that;
and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’
When they hear that
he has come down
they approach him.
The Buddha educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk.
They don’t even get around to asking their question to the Buddha, so how could they refute his answer?
Invariably, they become his disciples.
So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, I see some clever brahmins …
some clever householders …
some clever ascetics who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters.
…
They don’t even get around to asking their question to the Buddha, so how could they refute his answer?
Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth.
And he gives them the going-forth.
Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
‘We were almost lost! We almost perished!
For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things.
But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’
So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, these chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages. I give them a livelihood and bring them renown.
And yet they don’t show me the same level of devotion that they show to the Buddha.
Once it so happened that while I was leading a military campaign and testing Isidatta and Purāṇa I took up residence in a cramped house.
They spent most of the night discussing the teaching, then they lay down with their heads towards where the Buddha was and their feet towards me.
It occurred to me:
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
These chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa share my meals and my carriages. I give them a livelihood and bring them renown.
And yet they don’t show me the same level of devotion that they show to the Buddha.
Clearly these venerables have realized a higher distinction in the Buddha’s instructions than they had before.’
So I infer this about the Buddha from the teaching:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’
Furthermore, the Buddha is an aristocrat, and so am I.
The Buddha is Kosalan, and so am I.
The Buddha is eighty years old, and so am I.
Since this is so,
it’s proper for me to show the Buddha such utmost devotion and demonstrate such friendship.
Well, now, sir, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.”
“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”
Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, before he got up and left, King Pasenadi spoke shrines to the teaching.
Learn these shrines to the teaching!
Memorize these shrines to the teaching!
Remember these shrines to the teaching!
These shrines to the teaching are beneficial and relate to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Simile of the Saw
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot was mixing too closely together with the nuns.
So much so that
if any mendicant criticized those nuns in his presence, Phagguna of the Top-Knot got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.
And if any mendicant criticized Phagguna of the Top-Knot in their presence, those nuns got angry and upset, and even instigated disciplinary proceedings.
That’s how much Phagguna of the Top-Knot was mixing too closely together with the nuns.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was going on.
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot that
the teacher summons him.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Phagguna of the Top-Knot and said to him,
“Reverend Phagguna, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” Phagguna replied.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Is it really true, Phagguna, that you’ve been mixing overly closely together with the nuns?
So much so that
if any mendicant criticizes those nuns in your presence, you get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?
And if any mendicant criticizes you in those nuns’ presence, they get angry and upset, and even instigate disciplinary proceedings?
Is that how much you’re mixing overly closely together with the nuns?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Phagguna, are you not a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness?”
“Yes, sir.”
“As such, it’s not appropriate for you to mix so closely with the nuns.
So if anyone criticizes those nuns in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.
If that happens, you should train like this:
‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’
That’s how you should train.
So even if someone strikes those nuns with fists, stones, rods, and swords in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.
If that happens, you should train like this:
‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’
That’s how you should train.
So if anyone criticizes you in your presence, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.
If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’
That’s how you should train.
So Phagguṇa, even if someone strikes you with fists, stones, rods, and swords, you should give up any desires or thoughts of the lay life.
If that happens, you should train like this: ‘My mind will be unaffected. I will blurt out no bad words. I will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.’
That’s how you should train.”
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Mendicants, I used to be satisfied with the mendicants.
Once, I addressed them:
‘I eat my food in one sitting per day.
Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.
Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’
I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;
I just had to prompt their mindfulness.
Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.
Then a deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.
In the same way, I didn’t have to keep on instructing those mendicants;
I just had to prompt their mindfulness.
So, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.
In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.
Suppose that not far from a town or village there was a large grove of sal trees
that was choked with castor-oil weeds.
Then along comes a person who wants to help protect and nurture that grove.
They’d cut down the crooked sal saplings that were robbing the sap, and throw them out. They’d clean up the interior of the grove,
and properly care for the straight, well-formed sal saplings.
In this way, in due course, that sal grove would grow, increase, and mature.
In the same way, mendicants, you too should give up what’s unskillful and devote yourselves to skillful qualities.
In this way you’ll achieve growth, improvement, and maturity in this teaching and training.
Once upon a time, mendicants, right here in Sāvatthī there was a housewife named Vedehikā.
She had this good reputation:
‘The housewife Vedehikā is sweet, even-tempered, and calm.’
Now, Vedehikā had a bonded maid named Kāḷī who was skilled, tireless, and well-organized in her work.
Then Kāḷī thought,
‘My mistress has a good reputation as being
sweet, even-tempered, and calm.
But does she actually have anger in her and just not show it? Or does she have no anger?
Or is it just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside?
Why don’t I test my mistress?’
So Kāḷī got up during the day.
Vedehikā said to her,
‘What the hell, Kāḷī!’
‘What is it, madam?’
‘You’re getting up in the day—what’s up with you, girl?’
‘Nothing, madam.’
‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up in the day!’ Angry and upset, she scowled.
Then Kāḷī thought,
‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.
It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.
Why don’t I test my mistress further?’
So Kāḷī got up later in the day.
Vedehikā said to her,
‘What the hell, Kāḷī!’
‘What is it, madam?’
‘You’re getting up later in the day—what’s up with you, girl?’
‘Nothing, madam.’
‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she blurted out angry words.
Then Kāḷī thought,
‘My mistress actually has anger in her and just doesn’t show it; it’s not that she has no anger.
It’s just because my work is well-organized that she doesn’t show anger, even though she still has it inside.
Why don’t I test my mistress further?’
So Kāḷī got up even later in the day.
Vedehikā said to her,
‘What the hell, Kāḷī!’
‘What is it, madam?’
‘You’re getting up even later in the day—what’s up with you, girl?’
‘Nothing, madam.’
‘Nothing’s up, you bad girl, but you get up even later in the day!’ Angry and upset, she grabbed a rolling-pin and hit Kāḷī on the head, cracking it open.
Then Kāḷī, with blood pouring from her cracked skull, denounced her mistress to the neighbors,
‘See, ladies, what the sweet one did!
See what the even-tempered one did! See what the calm one did!
How on earth can she grab a rolling-pin and hit her only maid on the head, cracking it open, just for getting up late?’
Then after some time the housewife Vedehikā got this bad reputation:
‘The housewife Vedehikā is fierce, ill-tempered, and not calm at all.’
In the same way, a mendicant may be the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they don’t encounter any disagreeable criticism.
But it’s when they encounter disagreeable criticism that you’ll know whether they’re really sweet, even-tempered, and calm.
I don’t say that a mendicant is easy to admonish if they make themselves easy to admonish only for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
Why is that?
Because when they don’t get robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, they’re no longer easy to admonish.
But when a mendicant is easy to admonish purely because they honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching, then I say that they’re easy to admonish.
So, mendicants, you should train yourselves: ‘We will be easy to admonish purely because we honor, respect, revere, worship, and venerate the teaching.’
That’s how you should train.
Mendicants, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.
Their speech may be timely or untimely,
true or false,
gentle or harsh,
beneficial or harmful,
from a heart of love or from secret hate.
When others criticize you, they may do so in any of these ways.
If that happens, you should train like this:
‘Our minds will remain unaffected. We will blurt out no bad words. We will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.
We will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person. And with them as a basis, we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’
That’s how you should train.
Suppose a person was to come along carrying a spade and basket
‘I shall make this great earth be without earth!’
And they’d dig all over, scatter all over, spit all over, and urinate all over, saying,
‘Be without earth! Be without earth!’
What do you think, mendicants?
Could that person make this great earth be without earth?”
Why is that?
Because this great earth is deep and limitless.
It’s not easy to make it be without earth.
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”
“In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.

That’s how you should train.
Suppose a person was to come along with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder,
‘I shall draw pictures on the sky, making pictures appear there.’
What do you think, mendicants?
Could that person draw pictures on the sky?”
Why is that?
Because the sky is formless and invisible.
It’s not easy to draw pictures there.
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”
“In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you …
Suppose a person was to come along carrying a blazing grass torch,
‘I shall burn and scorch the river Ganges with this blazing grass torch.’
What do you think, mendicants?
Could that person burn and scorch the river Ganges with a blazing grass torch?”
Why is that?
Because the river Ganges is deep and limitless.
It’s not easy to burn and scorch it with a blazing grass torch.
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”
“In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you …
Suppose there was a catskin bag that was rubbed, well-rubbed, very well-rubbed, soft, silky, rid of rustling and crackling.
Then a person comes along carrying a stick or a stone,
‘I shall make this soft catskin bag rustle and crackle with this stick or stone.’
What do you think, mendicants?
Could that person make that soft catskin bag rustle and crackle with that stick or stone?”
Why is that?
Because that catskin bag is rubbed, well-rubbed, very well-rubbed, soft, silky, rid of rustling and crackling.
It’s not easy to make it rustle or crackle with a stick or stone.
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.”
“In the same way, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you.

That’s how you should train.
Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.
If that happens, you should train like this:
‘Our minds will remain unaffected. We will blurt out no bad words. We will remain full of compassion, with a heart of love and no secret hate.
We will meditate spreading a heart of love to that person. And with them as a basis, we will meditate spreading a heart full of love to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’
That’s how you should train.
If you frequently reflect on this advice—the simile of the saw—
do you see any criticism, large or small, that you could not endure?”
“No, sir.”
“So, mendicants, you should frequently reflect on this advice, the simile of the saw.
This will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Cātumā in a myrobalan grove.
Now at that time around five hundred mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Cātumā to see the Buddha.
And the visiting mendicants, while exchanging pleasantries with the resident mendicants, preparing their lodgings, and putting away their bowls and robes, made a dreadful racket.
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
And Ānanda told him what had happened.
“Well then, Ānanda, in my name tell those mendicants that
the teacher summons them.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. He went to those mendicants and said,
“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants.
Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:
“Mendicants, what’s with that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!”
And they told him what had happened.
“Go away, mendicants, I dismiss you. You are not to stay in my presence.”
“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. They got up from their seats, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. They set their lodgings in order and left, taking their bowls and robes.
Now at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some business.
Seeing those mendicants coming off in the distance,
they went up to them and said,
“Hello venerables, where are you going?”
“Sirs, the mendicant Saṅgha has been dismissed by the Buddha.”
“Well then, venerables, sit here for a minute. Hopefully we’ll be able to restore the Buddha’s confidence.”
“Yes, sirs,” replied the mendicants.
Then the Sakyans of Cātumā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“May the Buddha approve of the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!
There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.
If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.
If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart.
In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.
If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart.
In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.
May the Buddha approve of the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
“May the Buddha approve of the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!
There are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.
If young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. …
If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart.
In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. If they don’t get to see the Buddha they may change and fall apart.
May the Buddha approve of the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha!
May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!”
The Sakyans of Cātumā and Brahmā Sahampati were able to restore the Buddha’s confidence with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants,
“Get up, reverends, and pick up your bowls and robes.
The Buddha’s confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Cātumā and Brahmā Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the calf.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants.
Then they rose from their seats and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
“Sāriputta, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”
“Sir, I thought this:
‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.
Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life, and so will we.’”
“Hold on, Sāriputta, hold on! Don’t you ever think such a thing again!”
Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,
“Moggallāna, what did you think when the mendicant Saṅgha was dismissed by me?”
“Sir, I thought this:
‘The Buddha has dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha.
Now he will remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life. Meanwhile, Venerable Sāriputta and I will lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’”
“Good, good, Moggallāna!
For either I should lead the mendicant Saṅgha, or else Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Mendicants, when you go into the water you should anticipate four dangers.
What four?
The dangers of waves, crocodiles, whirlpools, and sharks.
These are the four dangers that anyone who enters the water should anticipate.
In the same way, a gentleman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate four dangers.
What four?
The dangers of waves, crocodiles, whirlpools, and sharks.
And what, mendicants, is the danger of waves?
It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:
‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’
When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:
‘You should go out like this, and come back like that. You should look to the front like this, and to the side like that. You should contract your limbs like this, and extend them like that. This is how you should bear your outer robe, bowl, and robes.’
They think:
‘Formerly, as laypeople, we advised and instructed others.
And now these mendicants—who you’d think were our children or grandchildren—imagine they can advise and instruct us!’
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
This is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of waves.
‘Danger of waves’ is a term for anger and distress.
And what, mendicants, is the danger of crocodiles?
It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:
‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’
When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them:
‘You may eat, consume, taste, and drink these things, but not those. You may eat what’s allowable, but not what’s unallowable. You may eat at the right time, but not at the wrong time.’
They think:
‘Formerly, as laypeople, we used to eat, consume, taste, and drink what we wanted, not what we didn’t want.
We ate and drank both allowable and unallowable things, at the right time and the wrong time.
And these faithful householders give us a variety of delicious foods at the wrong time of day. But these mendicants imagine they can gag our mouths!’
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
This is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of crocodiles.
‘Danger of crocodiles’ is a term for gluttony.
And what, mendicants, is the danger of whirlpools?
It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:
‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’
When they’ve gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties.
There they see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
They think:
‘Formerly, as laypeople, we amused ourselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
And it’s true that my family is wealthy.
I can both enjoy my wealth and make merit.’
They resign the training and return to a lesser life.
This is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of whirlpools.
‘Danger of whirlpools’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
And what, mendicants, is the danger of sharks?
It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking:
‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’
When they’ve gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties.
There they see a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes.
Lust infects their mind,
so they resign the training and return to a lesser life.
This is called one who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of sharks.
‘Danger of sharks’ is a term for females.
These are the four dangers that a gentleman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Longer Analysis of Deeds
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time Venerable Samiddhi was staying in a wilderness hut.
Then as the wanderer Potaliputta was going for a walk he came up to Venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:
“Reverend Samiddhi, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the ascetic Gotama:
‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’
And: ‘There is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.’”
“Don’t say that, Reverend Potaliputta, don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good.
And the Buddha would not say this.
But, reverend, there is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.”
“Reverend Samiddhi, how long has it been since you went forth?”
“Not long, reverend: three years.”
“Well now, what are we to say to the senior mendicants, when even such a junior mendicant imagines their Teacher needs defending?
After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, what does one feel?”
“After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, one feels suffering.”
Then, neither approving nor dismissing Samiddhi’s statement, Potaliputta
got up from his seat and left.
Soon after he had left, Venerable Samiddhi went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and informed Ānanda of all they had discussed.
When he had spoken, Ānanda said to him,
“Reverend Samiddhi, we should see the Buddha about this matter.
Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
“Yes, reverend,” Samiddhi replied.
Then Ānanda and Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and told him what had happened.
When they had spoken, the Buddha said to Ānanda,
“I don’t recall even seeing the wanderer Potaliputta, Ānanda, so how could we have had such a discussion?
The wanderer Potaliputta’s question should have been answered after analyzing it, but this foolish person answered definitively.”
When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him,
“But perhaps, sir, Venerable Samiddhi spoke in reference to the statement:
‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’”
But the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
“See how this foolish person Udāyī comes up with an idea?
I knew that
he was going to come up with such an irrational idea.
Right from the start Potaliputta asked about the three feelings.
Suppose the foolish person Samiddhi had answered the wanderer Potaliputta’s question like this:
‘After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as pleasant by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pleasure.
After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pain.
After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as neutral by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels neutral.’
Answering in this way, Samiddhi would have rightly answered Potaliputta.
Still, who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers who follow other paths to understand the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds?
Ānanda, if only you would all listen to the Realized One’s explanation of the great analysis of deeds.”
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
Let the Buddha explain the great analysis of deeds.
The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Ānanda, these four people are found in the world.
What four?
Some person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
But some other person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
But some other person here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, or using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
But some other person here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, or using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
Now, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that it gives rise to clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. With that clairvoyance they see that person
here who killed living creatures, stole, and committed sexual misconduct; who used speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and who was covetous, malicious, and had wrong view. And they see that, when their body breaks up, after death, that person is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
‘It seems that there is such a thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct.
For I saw a person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’
‘It seems that everyone who kills living creatures … and has wrong view is reborn in hell.
Those who know this are right. Those who know something else are wrong.’
And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that:
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’
But some other ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that it gives rise to clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. With that clairvoyance they see that person
here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And they see that that person is reborn in a heavenly realm.
‘It seems that there is no such thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct.
For I have seen a person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And I saw that that person was reborn in a heavenly realm.’
‘It seems that everyone who kills living creatures … and has wrong view is reborn in a heavenly realm.
Those who know this are right. Those who know something else are wrong.’
And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that:
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’
Take some ascetic or brahmin who with clairvoyance sees a person
here who refrained from killing living creatures … and had right view. And they see that that person is reborn in a heavenly realm.
‘It seems that there is such a thing as good deeds, and the result of good conduct.
For I have seen a person here who refrained from killing living creatures … and had right view. And I saw that that person was reborn in a heavenly realm.’
‘It seems that everyone who refrains from killing living creatures … and has right view is reborn in a heavenly realm.
Those who know this are right. Those who know something else are wrong.’
And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that:
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’
Take some ascetic or brahmin who with clairvoyance sees a person here who refrained from killing living creatures … and had right view. And they see that that person is reborn in hell.
‘It seems that there is no such thing as good deeds, and the result of good conduct.
For I have seen a person
here who refrained from killing living creatures … and had right view. And I saw that that person was reborn in hell.’
They say:
‘It seems that everyone who refrains from killing living creatures … and has right view is reborn in hell.
Those who know this are right. Those who know something else are wrong.’
And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that:
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’
In this case, when an ascetic or brahmin says this:
‘It seems that there is such a thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct,’ I grant them that.
And when they say:
‘I have seen a person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And after death, they were reborn in hell,’ I also grant them that.
But when they say:
‘It seems that everyone who kills living creatures … and has wrong view is reborn in hell,’ I don’t grant them that.
And when they say:
‘Those who know this are right. Those who know something else are wrong,’ I also don’t grant them that.
And when they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that:
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly,’ I also don’t grant them that.
Why is that?
Because the Realized One’s knowledge of the great analysis of deeds is otherwise.
In this case, when an ascetic or brahmin says this:
‘It seems that there is no such thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct,’ I don’t grant them that.

Why is that?
Because the Realized One’s knowledge of the great analysis of deeds is otherwise.
Now, Ānanda, take the case of the person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view, and who, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
They must have done a bad deed to be experienced as painful either previously or later, or else at the time of death they undertook wrong view.
And that’s why, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
But anyone here who kills living creatures … and has wrong view experiences the result of that in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
Now, Ānanda, take the case of the person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view, and who is reborn in a heavenly realm.
They must have done a good deed to be experienced as pleasant either previously or later, or else at the time of death they undertook right view.
And that’s why, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
But anyone here who kills living creatures … and has wrong view experiences the result of that in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.

But anyone here who refrains from killing living creatures … and has right view experiences the result of that in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period.
So, Ānanda, there are deeds that are ineffective and appear ineffective. There are deeds that are ineffective but appear effective. There are deeds that are effective and appear effective. And there are deeds that are effective but appear ineffective.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Vāseṭṭha
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included
the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.
Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discussion the question of
how one is a brahmin.
Bhāradvāja said this:
“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—
then you’re a brahmin.”
Vāseṭṭha said this:
“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—
then you’re a brahmin.”
But neither was able to persuade the other.
So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja,
“Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter.
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.
So they went to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side,
and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:
“We’re both authorized masters
of the three Vedas.
I’m a student of Pokkharasāti,
and he of Tārukkha.
We’re fully qualified
in all the Vedic experts teach.
As philologists and grammarians,
we match our teachers in recitation.
We have a dispute
regarding the question of ancestry.
For Bhāradvāja says that
one is a brahmin due to birth,
but I declare it’s because of one’s actions.
Oh seer, know this as our debate.
Since neither of us was able
to convince the other,
we’ve come to ask you, sir,
renowned as the awakened one.
As people honor with joined palms
the moon on the cusp of waxing,
bowing, they revere
Gotama in the world.
We ask this of Gotama,
the eye arisen in the world:
is one a brahmin due to birth,
or else because of actions?
We don’t know, please tell us,
so that we can know a brahmin.”
“I shall explain to you,” said the Buddha,
“accurately and in sequence,
the taxonomy of living creatures,
for species are indeed diverse.
Know the grass and trees,
though they lack self-awareness.
They’re defined by their birth,
for species are indeed diverse.
Next there are bugs and moths,
and so on, to ants and termites.
They’re defined by their birth,
for species are indeed diverse.
Know the quadrupeds, too,
both small and large.
They’re defined by their birth,
for species are indeed diverse.
Know, too, the long-backed snakes,
crawling on their bellies.
They’re defined by their birth,
for species are indeed diverse.
Next know the fish,
whose habitat is the water.
They’re defined by their birth,
for species are indeed diverse.
Next know the birds,
flying with wings as chariots.
They’re defined by their birth,
for species are indeed diverse.
While the differences between these species
are defined by their birth,
the differences between humans
are not defined by their birth.
Not by hair nor by head,
not by ear nor by eye,
not by mouth nor by nose,
not by lips nor by eyebrow,
not by shoulder nor by neck,
not by belly nor by back,
not by buttocks nor by breast,
not by genitals nor by groin,
not by hands nor by feet,
not by fingers nor by nails,
not by knees nor by thighs,
not by color nor by voice:
none of these are defined by birth
as it is for other species.
In individual human bodies
you can’t find such distinctions.
The distinctions among humans
are spoken of by convention.
Anyone among humans
who lives off keeping cattle:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a farmer, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who lives off various professions:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a professional, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who lives off trade:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a trader, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who lives off serving others:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as an employee, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who lives off stealing:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a bandit, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who lives off archery:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a soldier, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who lives off priesthood:
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a sacrificer, not a brahmin.
Anyone among humans
who taxes village and nation,
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as a ruler, not a brahmin.
I don’t call someone a brahmin
after the mother or womb they came from.
If they still have attachments,
they’re just someone who says ‘sir’.
One with nothing, never grasping:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Having cut off all fetters
they have no anxiety.
They’ve got over clinging, and are detached:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve cut the strap and harness,
the reins and bridle too,
with cross-bar lifted, they’re awakened:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Abuse, killing, caging:
they endure these without anger.
Patience is their powerful army:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Not irritable or stuck up,
dutiful in precepts and observances,
tamed, bearing their final body:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Like rain off a lotus leaf,
like a mustard seed off the point of a pin,
sensual pleasures slide off them:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They understand for themselves
in this life the end of suffering;
with burden put down, detached:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Deep in wisdom, intelligent,
expert in the variety of paths;
arrived at the highest goal:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Socializing with neither
householders nor the homeless.
A migrant without a shelter, few in wishes:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve laid aside the rod
against creatures firm and frail;
not killing or causing others to kill:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Not fighting among those who fight,
they’re extinguished among those who’ve taken up arms.
Not grasping among those who grasp:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve discarded greed and hate,
along with conceit and contempt,
like a mustard seed off the point of a pin:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
The words they utter
are sweet, informative, and true,
and don’t offend anyone:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They don’t steal anything in the world,
long or short,
fine or coarse, beautiful or ugly:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They have no hope
for this world or the next;
free of hope, detached:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They have no clinging,
knowledge has freed them of indecision,
they’ve arrived at the culmination of the deathless:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve escaped clinging
to both good and bad deeds;
sorrowless, stainless, pure:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Pure as the spotless moon,
clear and undisturbed,
they’ve ended desire to be reborn:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve got past this grueling swamp
of delusion, transmigration.
They’ve crossed over to the far shore,
stilled and free of indecision.
They’re extinguished by not grasping:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve given up sensual stimulations,
and have gone forth from lay life;
they’ve ended rebirth in the sensual realm:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve given up craving,
and have gone forth from lay life;
they’ve ended craving to be reborn:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They’ve given up human bonds,
and gone beyond heavenly bonds;
detached from all attachments:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Giving up discontent and desire,
they’re cooled and free of attachments;
a hero, master of the whole world:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They know the passing away
and rebirth of all beings;
unattached, holy, awakened:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Gods, fairies, and humans
don’t know their destiny;
the perfected ones with defilements ended:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They have nothing before or after,
or even in between;
one with nothing, never grasping:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
Leader of the herd, excellent hero,
great hermit and victor;
unstirred, washed, awakened:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
They know their past lives,
and see heaven and places of loss,
and have attained the end of rebirth:
that’s who I call a brahmin.
For name and clan are assigned
as mere convention in the world.
Arising by mutual agreement,
they’re assigned to each individual.
For a long time this misconception
has prejudiced those who don’t understand.
Ignorant, they declare
that one is a brahmin by birth.
You’re not a brahmin by birth,
nor by birth a non-brahmin.
You’re a brahmin by your deeds,
and by deeds a non-brahmin.
You’re a farmer by your deeds,
by deeds you’re a professional;
you’re a trader by your deeds,
by deeds are you an employee;
you’re a bandit by your deeds,
by deeds you’re a soldier;
you’re a sacrificer by your deeds,
by deeds you’re a ruler.
In this way the astute regard deeds
in accord with truth.
Seeing dependent origination,
they’re expert in deeds and their results.
Deeds make the world go on,
deeds make people go on;
sentient beings are bound by deeds,
like a moving chariot’s linchpin.
By austerity and spiritual practice,
by restraint and by self-control:
that’s how to become a brahmin,
this is the supreme brahmin.
Accomplished in the three knowledges,
peaceful, with rebirth ended,
know them, Vāseṭṭha,
as Brahmā and Sakka to the wise.”
When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
The Honey-Cake
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms.
He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Great Wood,
plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation.
Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk,
plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Buddha,
“What does the ascetic teach? What does he explain?”
“Sir, my teaching is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without doubting, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state.
That’s what I teach, and that’s what I explain.”
When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and he departed leaning on his staff.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out,
and told the mendicants what had happened.
When he had spoken, one of the mendicants said to him,
“But sir, what is the teaching such that the Buddha does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans?
And how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha, the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state?”
“Mendicant, a person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions.
If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise,
just this is the end of the underlying tendencies to desire, repulsion, views, doubt, conceit, the desire to be reborn, and ignorance. This is the end of taking up the rod and the sword, the end of quarrels, arguments, and fights, of accusations, divisive speech, and lies.
This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.”
That is what the Buddha said.
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha?”
Then those mendicants thought,
“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”
Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.
They told him what had happened, and said:
“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”
“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.
Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you passed him by, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is holiness. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is holiness. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.
Still, Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”
“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:
“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
‘A person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions.
If they don’t find anything worth approving, welcoming, or getting attached to in the source from which these arise …
This is where these bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.’ This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate. What you proliferate about is the source from which a person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions. This occurs with respect to sights known by the eye in the past, future, and present.
Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. …
Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. …
Tongue consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. …
Body consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. …
Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts. The meeting of the three is contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. What you feel, you perceive. What you perceive, you think about. What you think about, you proliferate. What you proliferate about is the source from which a person is beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions. This occurs with respect to thoughts known by the mind in the past, future, and present.
When there is the eye, sights, and eye consciousness, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘contact’.
When there is what’s known as contact, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘feeling’.
When there is what’s known as feeling, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘perception’.
When there is what’s known as perception, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘thought’.
When there is what’s known as thought, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘being beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions’.
When there is the ear …
mind, thoughts, and mind consciousness, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘contact’. …
When there is what’s known as thought, it’s possible to point out what’s known as ‘being beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions’.
When there is no eye, no sights, and no eye consciousness, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘contact’.
When there isn’t what’s known as contact, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘feeling’.
When there isn’t what’s known as feeling, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘perception’.
When there isn’t what’s known as perception, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘thought’.
When there isn’t what’s known as thought, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘being beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions’.
When there is no ear …
mind, no thoughts, and no mind consciousness, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘contact’. …
When there isn’t what’s known as thought, it’s not possible to point out what’s known as ‘being beset by concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions’.
This is how I understand the detailed meaning of that brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Yes, reverend,” said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said.
Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then they said:
“Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”
“Mahākaccāna is astute, mendicants, he has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Sir, suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake. Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor.
In the same way, wherever a sincere, capable mendicant might examine with wisdom the meaning of this exposition of the teaching they would only gain joy and clarity.
Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”
“Well, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Honey-Cake Discourse’.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Sixfold Purification
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Take a mendicant who declares enlightenment:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’
You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.
Rather, you should question them:
‘Reverend, these four kinds of expression have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
What four?
One speaks of the seen as seen, the heard as heard, the thought as thought, and the known as known.
These are the four kinds of expression rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
How does the venerable know and see regarding these four kinds of expression so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’
For a mendicant with defilements ended—who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—it is in line with the teaching to answer:
‘Reverends, I live without attraction or repulsion for what is seen; independent, untied, liberated, detached, my mind free of limits.
I live without attraction or repulsion for what is heard …
or known; independent, untied, liberated, detached, my mind free of limits.
That is how I know and see regarding these four kinds of expression so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’
Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,
then ask a further question:
‘Reverend, these five grasping aggregates have been rightly explained by the Buddha.
What five?
That is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
These are the five grasping aggregates that have been rightly explained by the Buddha.
How does the venerable know and see regarding these five grasping aggregates so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’
For a mendicant with defilements ended it is in line with the teaching to answer:
‘Reverends, knowing that form is powerless, fading, and unreliable, I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for form.
Knowing that feeling …
perception …
consciousness is powerless, fading, and unreliable, I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for consciousness.
That is how I know and see regarding these five grasping aggregates so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’
Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,
then ask a further question:
‘Reverend, these six elements have been rightly explained by the Buddha.
The elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.
These are the six elements that have been rightly explained by the Buddha.
How does the venerable know and see regarding these six elements so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’
For a mendicant with defilements ended it is in line with the teaching to answer:
‘Reverends, I’ve not taken the earth element as self, nor is there a self based on the earth element.
And I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency based on the earth element.
I’ve not taken the water element …
fire element …
air element …
space element …
consciousness element as self, nor is there a self based on the consciousness element.
And I understand that my mind is freed through the ending of attraction based on the consciousness element.
That is how I know and see regarding these six elements so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’
Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,
then ask a further question:
‘Reverend, these six interior and exterior sense fields have been rightly explained by the Buddha.
The eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and thoughts.
These are the six interior and exterior sense fields that have been rightly explained by the Buddha.
How does the venerable know and see regarding these six interior and exterior sense fields so that your mind is freed from defilements by not grasping?’
For a mendicant with defilements ended it is in line with the teaching to answer:
‘I understand that my mind is freed through the ending, fading away, cessation, giving away, and letting go of desire and greed and relishing and craving; attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency for the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness.
I understand that my mind is freed through the ending of desire for the ear …
mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness.
That is how I know and see regarding these six interior and exterior sense fields so that my mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.’
Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,
then ask a further question:
‘Sir, how does the venerable know and see so that he has eradicated ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?’
For a mendicant with defilements ended it is in line with the teaching to answer:
‘Formerly, reverends, when I was still a layperson, I was ignorant.
Then the Realized One or one of his disciples taught me the Dhamma.
I gained faith in the Realized One,
and reflected:
“Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”
After some time I gave up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. I shaved off hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Once I had gone forth, I took up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. I gave up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I was scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.
I gave up stealing. I took only what’s given, and expected only what’s given. I kept myself clean by not thieving.
I gave up unchastity. I became celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.
I gave up lying. I spoke the truth and stuck to the truth. I was honest and trustworthy, not tricking the world with my words.
I gave up divisive speech. I didn’t repeat in one place what I heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, I reconciled those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.
I gave up harsh speech. I spoke in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.
I gave up talking nonsense. My words were timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. I said things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.
I avoided injuring plants and seeds. I ate in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.
I avoided dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows.
I avoided beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, perfumes, and makeup.
I avoided high and luxurious beds.
I avoided receiving gold and money,
raw grains,
women and girls,
male and female bondservants,
goats and sheep,
chicken and pigs,
elephants, cows, horses, and mares,
and fields and land.
I avoided running errands and messages;
buying and selling;
falsifying weights, metals, or measures;
bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity;
mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.
I became content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly.
Wherever I went, I set out taking only these things.
Like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden.
In the same way, I became content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly.
Wherever I went, I set out taking only these things.
When I had this entire spectrum of noble ethics, I experienced a blameless happiness inside myself.
When I saw a sight with my eyes, I didn’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, I practiced restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
When I heard a sound with my ears …
When I smelled an odor with my nose …
When I tasted a flavor with my tongue …
When I felt a touch with my body …
When I knew a thought with my mind, I didn’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of the mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, I practiced restraint, protecting the faculty of the mind, and achieving its restraint.
When I had this noble sense restraint, I experienced an unsullied bliss inside myself.
I acted with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
When I had this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness,
I frequented a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
After the meal, I returned from alms-round, sat down cross-legged with my body straight, and established mindfulness right there.
Giving up desire for the world, I meditated with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
Giving up ill will and malevolence, I meditated with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, I meditated with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
Giving up restlessness and remorse, I meditated without restlessness, my mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
Giving up doubt, I meditated having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
I gave up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
I truly understood: “This is suffering” … “This is the origin of suffering” … “This is the cessation of suffering” … “This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering”.
I truly understood: “These are defilements”… “This is the origin of defilements” … “This is the cessation of defilements” … “This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements”.
Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When it was freed, I knew it was freed.
I understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
That is how I know and see so that I have eradicated ego, possessiveness, and underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.’
Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement,
and then say to them:
‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Esukārī
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Esukārī the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four kinds of service:
for a brahmin, an aristocrat, a merchant, and a worker.
This is the service they prescribe for a brahmin:
‘A brahmin, an aristocrat, a merchant, and a worker may all serve a brahmin.’
This is the service they prescribe for an aristocrat:
‘An aristocrat, a merchant, and a worker may all serve an aristocrat.’
This is the service they prescribe for a merchant:
‘A merchant or a worker may serve a merchant.’
This is the service they prescribe for a worker:
‘Only a worker may serve a worker.
For who else will serve a worker?’
These are the four kinds of service that the brahmins prescribe.
What do you say about this?”
“But brahmin, did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of service?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“It’s as if they were to force a steak on a poor, penniless person, telling them they must eat it and then pay for it.
In the same way, the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of service without the consent of these ascetics and brahmins.
Brahmin, I don’t say that you should serve everyone, nor do I say that you shouldn’t serve anyone.
I say that you shouldn’t serve someone if serving them makes you worse, not better.
And I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you better, not worse.
If they were to ask an aristocrat this,
‘Who should you serve? Someone in whose service you get worse, or someone in whose service you get better?’
Answering rightly, an aristocrat would say,
‘Someone in whose service I get better.’
If they were to ask a brahmin …
a merchant …
or a worker this,
‘Who should you serve? Someone in whose service you get worse, or someone in whose service you get better?’
Answering rightly, a worker would say,
‘Someone in whose service I get better.’
Brahmin, I don’t say that coming from an eminent family makes you a better or worse person.
I don’t say that being very beautiful makes you a better or worse person.
I don’t say that being very wealthy makes you a better or worse person.
For some people from eminent families kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view.
That’s why I don’t say that coming from an eminent family makes you a better person.
But some people from eminent families also refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view.
That’s why I don’t say that coming from an eminent family makes you a worse person.
People who are very beautiful,
who are very wealthy,
may also behave in the same ways.
That’s why I don’t say that any of these things makes you a better or worse person.
Brahmin, I don’t say that you should serve everyone, nor do I say that you shouldn’t serve anyone.
And I say that you should serve someone if serving them makes you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.
I say that you shouldn’t serve someone if serving them doesn’t make you grow in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.”
When he had spoken, Esukārī said to him:
“Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four kinds of wealth:
for a brahmin, an aristocrat, a merchant, and a worker.
The wealth they prescribe for a brahmin is living on alms.
A brahmin who scorns his own wealth, living on alms, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.
The wealth they prescribe for an aristocrat is the bow and quiver.
An aristocrat who scorns his own wealth, the bow and quiver, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.
The wealth they prescribe for a merchant is farming and animal husbandry.
A merchant who scorns his own wealth, farming and animal husbandry, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.
The wealth they prescribe for a worker is the scythe and flail.
A worker who scorns his own wealth, the scythe and flail, fails in his duty like a guard who steals.
These are the four kinds of wealth that the brahmins prescribe.
What do you say about this?”
“But brahmin, did the whole world authorize the brahmins to prescribe these four kinds of wealth?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“It’s as if they were to force a steak on a poor, penniless person, telling them they must eat it and then pay for it.
In the same way, the brahmins have prescribed these four kinds of wealth without the consent of these ascetics and brahmins.
I declare that a person’s own wealth is the noble, transcendent teaching.
But they are reckoned by recollecting the traditional family lineage of their mother and father wherever they are incarnated.
If they incarnate in a family of aristocrats they are reckoned as an aristocrat.
If they incarnate in a family of brahmins they are reckoned as a brahmin.
If they incarnate in a family of merchants they are reckoned as a merchant.
If they incarnate in a family of workers they are reckoned as a worker.
It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it burns.
A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire.
A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire.
A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire.
A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire.
In the same way, I declare that a person’s own wealth is the noble, transcendent teaching.
But they are reckoned by recollecting the traditional family lineage of their mother and father wherever they are incarnated.
Suppose someone from a family of aristocrats goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One they refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and sex. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view. They succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.
Suppose someone from a family of brahmins …
merchants …
workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One … they succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.
What do you think, brahmin?
Is only a brahmin capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this region, and not an aristocrat, merchant, or worker?”
“No, Master Gotama.
Aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers can all do so.
For all four classes are capable of developing a heart of love free of enmity and ill will for this region.”
“In the same way, suppose someone from a family of aristocrats,
merchants,
or workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One … they succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.
What do you think, brahmin?
Is only a brahmin capable of taking some bathing paste of powdered shell, going to the river, and washing off dust and dirt, and not an aristocrat, merchant, or worker?”
“No, Master Gotama.
All four classes are capable of doing this.”
“In the same way, suppose someone from a family of aristocrats,
merchants,
or workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One … they succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.
What do you think, brahmin?
Suppose an anointed aristocratic king were to gather a hundred people born in different castes and say to them:
‘Please gentlemen, let anyone here who was born in a family of aristocrats, brahmins, or chieftains take a drill-stick made of teak, sal, frankincense wood, sandalwood, or cherry wood, light a fire and produce heat.
And let anyone here who was born in a family of outcastes, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors take a drill-stick made from a dog’s drinking trough, a pig’s trough, a dustbin, or castor-oil wood, light a fire and produce heat.’
What do you think, brahmin?
Would only the fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood have flames, color, and radiance, and be usable as fire,
and not the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality wood?”
“No, Master Gotama.
The fire produced by the high class people with good quality wood would have flames, color, and radiance, and be usable as fire,
and so would the fire produced by the low class people with poor quality wood.
For all fire has flames, color, and radiance, and is usable as fire.”
“In the same way, suppose someone from a family of aristocrats,
merchants,
or workers goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. Relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One they refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and sex. They refrain from using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re not covetous or malicious, and they have right view. They succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.”
When he had spoken, Esukārī said to him,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
Measuring Up
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:
“Reverends, mendicants!”
“Reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:
“Suppose a mendicant invites
other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They're impatient, and don't take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions don’t think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that person doesn’t gain their trust.
And what are the qualities that make them hard to admonish?
Firstly, a mendicant has wicked desires, having fallen under the sway of wicked desires.
This is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.
Furthermore, a mendicant glorifies themselves and puts others down. …
They’re irritable, overcome by anger …
They’re irritable, and hostile due to anger …
They’re irritable, and stubborn due to anger …
They’re irritable, and blurt out words bordering on anger …
When accused, they object to the accuser …
When accused, they rebuke the accuser …
When accused, they retort to the accuser …
When accused, they dodge the issue, distract the discussion with irrelevant points, and display annoyance, hate, and bitterness …
When accused, they don’t accept the consequences of their deeds …
They are offensive and contemptuous …
They’re jealous and stingy …
They’re devious and deceitful …
They’re obstinate and vain …
Furthermore, a mendicant is attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go.
This too is a quality that makes them difficult to admonish.
These are the qualities that make them hard to admonish.
Suppose a mendicant doesn’t invite
other mendicants to admonish them. But they’re easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They're accepting, and take instruction respectfully. So their spiritual companions think it’s worth advising and instructing them, and that person gains their trust.
And what are the qualities that make them easy to admonish?
Firstly, a mendicant doesn’t have wicked desires …
Furthermore, a mendicant isn’t attached to their own views, not holding them tight, but letting them go easily.
These are the qualities that make them easy to admonish.
In such a case, a mendicant should measure themselves against another like this.
‘This person has wicked desires, having fallen under the sway of wicked desires. And I don’t like or approve of this person.
And if I were to fall under the sway of wicked desires, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’
A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not fall under the sway of wicked desires.’ …
‘This person is attached to their own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go. And I don’t like or approve of this person.
And if I were to be attached to my own views, holding them tight and refusing to let go, others wouldn’t like or approve of me.’
A mendicant who knows this should give rise to the thought: ‘I will not be attached to my own views, holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’
In such a case, a mendicant should check themselves like this:
‘Do I have wicked desires? Have I fallen under the sway of wicked desires?’
Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
they have fallen under the sway of wicked desires. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities.
But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
they haven’t fallen under the sway of wicked desires. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities. …
Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
they are attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go. Then they should make an effort to give up those bad, unskillful qualities.
Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant knows that
they’re not attached to their own views, holding them tight, but let them go easily. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.
Suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should make an effort to give them all up.
But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they see any dirt or blemish there, they’d try to remove it.
But if they don’t see any dirt or blemish there, they’re happy, thinking:
‘How fortunate that I’m clean!’
In the same way, suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they haven’t given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should make an effort to give them all up.
But suppose that, upon checking, a mendicant sees that they have given up all these bad, unskillful qualities. Then they should meditate with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities.”
This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said.
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in a woodland grove behind the town.
Now at that time Sunakkhatta the Licchavi had recently left this teaching and training.
He was telling a crowd in Vesālī:
“The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.
And his teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.”
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
He heard what Sunakkhatta was saying.
Then he wandered for alms in Vesālī.
After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta, that silly man, is angry.
His words are spoken out of anger.
Thinking he criticizes the Realized One, in fact he just praises him.
For it is praise of the Realized One to say:
‘His teaching leads those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it’s taught.’
But there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:
‘That Blessed One wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.’
And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:
‘That Blessed One, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hears both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’
And there’s no way Sunakkhatta will infer about me from the teaching:
‘That Blessed One understands the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with his own mind.
He understands mind with greed as “mind with greed,”
and mind without greed as “mind without greed.”
He understands mind with hate …
mind without hate …
mind with delusion …
mind without delusion …
constricted mind …
scattered mind …
expansive mind …
unexpansive mind …
mind that is supreme …
mind that is not supreme …
mind immersed in samādhi …
mind not immersed in samādhi …
freed mind as “freed mind,”
and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind.”’
The Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible, and the impossible as impossible.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and reasons.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse attitudes of sentient beings.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.
He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. …
Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.
He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One.
…
Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.
Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
A Realized One possesses these ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this:
‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
He teaches what he’s worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.’
Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
Just as a mendicant accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life, such is the consequence, I say.
Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
Sāriputta, a Realized One has four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
What four?
I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘You claim to be fully awakened, but you don’t understand these things.’
Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘You claim to have ended all defilements, but these defilements have not ended.’
Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘The acts that you say are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.’
Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
I see no reason for anyone—whether ascetic, brahmin, god, Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone else in the world—to legitimately scold me, saying: ‘The teaching doesn’t lead those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which you taught it.’
Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
A Realized One has these four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this:
‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones …’
Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
Sāriputta, there are these eight assemblies.
What eight?
The assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An assembly of the gods under the Four Great Kings. An assembly of the gods under the Thirty-Three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of Brahmās.
These are the eight assemblies.
Possessing these four kinds of self-assurance, the Realized One approaches and enters right into these eight assemblies.
I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats.
There I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion.
But I don’t see any reason to feel afraid or insecure.
Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of brahmins …
householders …
ascetics …
the gods under the Four Great Kings …
the gods under the Thirty-Three …
There too I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion.
But I don’t see any reason to feel afraid or insecure.
Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured.
When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this:
‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones …’
Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
Sāriputta, there are these four kinds of reproduction.
What four?
Reproduction for creatures born from an egg, from a womb, from moisture, or spontaneously.
And what is reproduction from an egg?
There are beings who are born by breaking out of an eggshell.
This is called reproduction from an egg.
And what is reproduction from a womb?
There are beings who are born by breaking out of the amniotic sac.
This is called reproduction from a womb.
And what is reproduction from moisture?
There are beings who are born in a rotten fish, in a rotten corpse, in rotten dough, in a cesspool or a sump.
This is called reproduction from moisture.
And what is spontaneous reproduction?
Gods, hell-beings, certain humans, and certain beings in the lower realms.
This is called spontaneous reproduction.
These are the four kinds of reproduction.
When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this:
‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones …’
Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
There are these five destinations.
What five?
Hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, humanity, and the gods.
I understand hell, and the path and practice that leads to hell.
And I understand how someone practicing that way, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
I understand the animal realm …
the ghost realm …
humanity …
gods, and the path and practice that leads to the world of the gods.
And I understand how someone practicing that way, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
And I understand extinguishment, and the path and practice that leads to extinguishment.
And I understand how someone practicing that way realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:
‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn in hell, where they experience exclusively painful feelings, sharp and severe.
Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, full of glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. And they have set out on a path that meets with that same pit of coals.
If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say:
‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very pit of coals.’
Then some time later they see that they have indeed fallen into that pit of coals, where they experience exclusively painful feelings, sharp and severe. …
When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:
‘This person … will be reborn in the animal realm.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn in the animal realm, where they suffer painful feelings, sharp and severe.
Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. And they have set out on a path that meets with that same sewer.
If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say:
‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very sewer.’
Then some time later they see that they have indeed fallen into that sewer, where they suffer painful feelings, sharp and severe. …
When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:
‘This person … will be reborn in the ghost realm.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn in the ghost realm, where they experience many painful feelings.
Suppose there was a tree growing on rugged ground, with thin foliage casting dappled shade.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. And they have set out on a path that meets with that same tree.
If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say:
‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very tree.’
Then some time later they see them sitting or lying under that tree, where they experience many painful feelings. …
When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:
‘This person … will be reborn among human beings.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn among human beings, where they experience many pleasant feelings.
Suppose there was a tree growing on smooth ground, with abundant foliage casting dense shade.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. And they have set out on a path that meets with that same tree.
If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say:
‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very tree.’
Then some time later they see them sitting or lying under that tree, where they experience many pleasant feelings. …
When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:
‘This person … will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed been reborn in a heavenly realm, where they experience exclusively pleasant feelings.
Suppose there was a stilt longhouse with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered.
And it had a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. And they have set out on a path that meets with that same stilt longhouse.
If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say:
‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very stilt longhouse.’
Then some time later they see them sitting or lying in that stilt longhouse, where they experience exclusively pleasant feelings. …
When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:
‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that they will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, experiencing exclusively pleasant feelings.
Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.
And nearby was a dark forest grove.
Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. And they have set out on a path that meets with that same lotus pond.
If a person with good eyesight saw them, they’d say:
‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that they will arrive at that very lotus pond.’
Then some time later they would see that person after they had plunged into that lotus pond, bathed and drunk. When all their stress, weariness, and heat exhaustion had faded away, they emerged and sat or lay down in that woodland thicket, where they experienced exclusively pleasant feelings.
In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand:
‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that they will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
Then some time later I see that they have indeed realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, experiencing exclusively pleasant feelings.
These are the five destinations.

‘The ascetic Gotama has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.

Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.
Sāriputta, I recall having practiced a spiritual path consisting of four factors.
I used to be a self-mortifier, the ultimate self-mortifier. I used to live rough, the ultimate rough-liver. I used to live in disgust at sin, the ultimate one living in disgust at sin. I used to be secluded, in ultimate seclusion.
And this is what my self-mortification was like. I went naked, ignoring conventions. I licked my hands, and didn’t come or stop when asked. I didn’t consent to food brought to me, or food prepared specially for me, or an invitation for a meal.
I didn’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where food for distribution is advertised; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. I accepted no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drank no beer.
I went to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls.
I fed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day.
I ate once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. I lived committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals.
I ate herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. I survived on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit.
I wore robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings.
I tore out hair and beard, committed to this practice.
I constantly stood, refusing seats.
I squatted, committed to the endeavor of squatting.
I lay on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns my bed.
I was committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening.
And so I lived committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.
Such was my practice of self-mortification.
And this is what my rough living was like.
The dust and dirt built up on my body over many years until it started flaking off.
It’s like the trunk of a pale-moon ebony tree, which builds up bark over many years until it starts flaking off.
But it didn’t occur to me:
‘Oh, this dust and dirt must be rubbed off by my hand or another’s.’
That didn’t occur to me.
Such was my rough living.
And this is what my living in disgust of sin was like.
I’d step forward or back ever so mindfully. I was full of pity even regarding a drop of water, thinking:
‘May I not accidentally injure any little creatures that happen to be in the wrong place.’
Such was my living in disgust of sin.
And this is what my seclusion was like.
I would plunge deep into a wilderness region and stay there.
When I saw a cowherd or a shepherd, or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a lumberjack, I’d flee from forest to forest, from thicket to thicket, from valley to valley, from uplands to uplands.
Why is that?
So that I wouldn’t see them, nor they me.
I fled like a wild deer seeing a human being.
Such was my practice of seclusion.
I would go on all fours into the cow-pens after the cattle had left and eat the dung of the young suckling calves.
As long as my own urine and excrement lasted, I would even eat that.
Such was my eating of most unnatural things.
I would plunge deep into an awe-inspiring forest grove and stay there.
It was so awe-inspiring that
normally it would make your hair stand on end if you weren’t free of greed.
And on days such as the cold spell when the snow falls in the dead of winter, I stayed in the open by night and in the forest by day.
But in the last month of summer I’d stay in the open by day and in the forest by night.
And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:
‘Scorched and frozen,
alone in the awe-inspiring forest.
Naked, no fire to sit beside,
the sage still pursues his quest.’
I would make my bed in a charnel ground, with the bones of the dead for a pillow.
Then the cowboys would come up to me. They’d spit and piss on me, throw mud on me, even poke sticks in my ears.
But I don’t recall ever having a bad thought about them.
Such was my abiding in equanimity.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from food.’
‘Let’s live on jujubes.’
So they eat jujubes and jujube powder, and drink jujube juice.
And they enjoy many jujube concoctions.
I recall eating just a single jujube.
You might think that
at that time the jujubes must have been very big.
But you should not see it like this.
The jujubes then were at most the same size as today.
Eating so very little, my body became extremely emaciated.
Due to eating so little, my limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a corpse,
my bottom became like a camel’s hoof,
my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string,
and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn.
Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well.
Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun.
Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly.
Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there.
Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from food.’
‘Let’s live on mung beans.’ …
‘Let’s live on sesame.’ …
‘Let’s live on ordinary rice.’ …
Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out.
But Sāriputta, I did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work.
Why is that?
Because I didn’t achieve that noble wisdom that’s noble and emancipating, and which leads someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from transmigration.’
But it’s not easy to find a realm that I haven’t previously transmigrated to in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes.
For if I had transmigrated to the gods of the pure abodes I would not have returned to this realm again.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from rebirth.’
But it’s not easy to find any rebirth that I haven’t previously been reborn in …
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from abode of rebirth.’
But it’s not easy to find an abode where I haven’t previously abided …
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from sacrifice.’
But it’s not easy to find a sacrifice that I haven’t previously offered in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Purity comes from serving the sacred flame.’
But it’s not easy to find a fire that I haven’t previously served in all this long time, when I was an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life he will be endowed with perfect lucidity of wisdom.
But when he’s old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—he will lose his lucidity of wisdom.’
But you should not see it like this.
For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.
Suppose I had four disciples with a lifespan of a hundred years. And they each were perfect in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.
Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow would shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree.
That’s how extraordinary they were in memory, range, retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom.
They’d bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness meditation again and again, and I would answer each question. They’d remember the answers and not ask the same question twice.
And they’d pause only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness. But the Realized One would not run out of Dhamma teachings, words and phrases of the teachings, or spontaneous answers.
And at the end of a hundred years my four disciples would pass away.
Even if you have to carry me around on a stretcher, there will never be any deterioration in the Realized One’s lucidity of wisdom.
And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that
a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.”
Now at that time Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.
Then he said to the Buddha:
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
While I was listening to this exposition of the teaching my hair stood up!
What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”
“Well, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Hair-raising Discourse’.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Nāgasamāla was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Corruptions
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambi were arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him what was happening, adding:
“Please, sir go to those mendicants out of compassion.”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said,
“Enough, mendicants! Stop arguing, quarreling, and fighting.”
When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,
“Wait, sir!
Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,
remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life.
We will be known for this arguing, quarreling, and fighting.”
For a second time …
and a third time the Buddha said to those mendicants,
“Enough, mendicants! Stop arguing, quarreling, and fighting.”
For a third time that mendicant said to the Buddha,
“Wait, sir!
Let the Buddha, the Lord of the Dhamma,
remain passive, dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life.
We will be known for this arguing, quarreling, and fighting.”
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms.
After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he set his lodgings in order. Taking his bowl and robe, he recited these verses while standing right there:
“When many voices shout at once,
no-one thinks that they’re a fool!
While the Saṅgha’s being split,
none thought another to be better.
Dolts pretending to be astute,
they talk, their words right out of bounds.
They blab at will, their mouths agape,
and no-one knows what leads them on.
“They abused me, they hit me!
They beat me, they robbed me!”
For those who bear such a grudge,
hatred never ends.
“They abused me, they hit me!
They beat me, they robbed me!”
For those who bear no such grudge,
hatred has an end.
For never is hatred
settled by hate,
it’s only settled by love:
this is an ancient law.
Others don’t understand
that here we need to be restrained.
But those who do understand this,
being clever, settle their quarrels.
Breakers of bones and takers of life,
thieves of cattle, horses, wealth,
those who plunder the nation:
even they can come together,
so why on earth can’t you?
If you find an alert companion,
a wise and virtuous friend,
then, overcoming all challenges,
wander with them, joyful and mindful.
If you find no alert companion,
no wise and virtuous friend,
then, like a king who flees his conquered realm,
wander alone like a tusker in the wilds.
It’s better to wander alone,
there’s no fellowship with fools.
Wander alone and do no wrong,
at ease like a tusker in the wilds.”
After speaking these verses while standing, the Buddha went to the village of the child salt-miners,
where Venerable Bhagu was staying at the time.
Bhagu saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,
so he spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,
and washed his feet.
Bhagu bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting alms-food.”
“I’m keeping well, sir; I’m all right. And I’m having no trouble getting alms-food.”
Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Bhagu with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and set out for the Eastern Bamboo Park.
Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Park.
The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and said to the Buddha,
“Don’t come into this park, ascetic.
There are three gentlemen who love themselves staying here.
Don’t disturb them.”
Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,
and said to him,
“Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!
Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”
Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,
“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”
Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.
One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
and washed his feet.
Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to Anuruddha,
“I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re all right. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting alms-food.”
“We’re keeping well, sir; we’re all right. And we’re having no trouble getting alms-food.”
“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”
“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony as you say.”
“But how do you live this way?”
“In this case, sir, I think:
‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,
to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’
I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.
‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’
And that’s what I do.
Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”
And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added:
“That’s how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”
“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”
“But how do you live this way?”
“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from alms-round prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.
If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.
Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.
If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up.
If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lifting it with their hands. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.
And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.
That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”
“Well, sir, while meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, we perceive both light and vision of forms.
But before long the light and the vision of forms vanish.
We haven’t worked out the reason for that.”
“Well, you should work out the reason for that.
Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too perceived both light and vision of forms.
But before long my light and vision of forms vanished.
It occurred to me:
‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason why my light and vision of forms vanish?’
It occurred to me:
‘Doubt arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
I’ll make sure that doubt will not arise in me again.’
While meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived both light and vision of forms.
But before long my light and vision of forms vanished.
It occurred to me:
‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason why my light and vision of forms vanish?’
It occurred to me:
‘Loss of focus arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Dullness and drowsiness arose in me …
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Terror arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
Suppose a person was traveling along a road, and killers were to spring out at them from both sides. They’d feel terrified because of that.
In the same way, terror arose in me …
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Excitement arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
Suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across five entrances! They’d feel excited because of that.
In the same way, excitement arose in me …
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Discomfort arose in me …
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Excessive energy arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
Suppose a person was to grip a quail too tightly in this hands—it would die right there.
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Overly lax energy arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
Suppose a person was to grip a quail too loosely—it would fly out of their hands.
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Longing arose in me …
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy nor longing will arise in me again.’
While meditating …
‘Perceptions of diversity arose in me …
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy nor longing nor perception of diversity will arise in me again.’
While meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived both light and vision of forms.
But before long my light and vision of forms vanished.
It occurred to me:
‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason why my light and vision of forms vanish?’
It occurred to me:
‘Excessive concentration on forms arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away.
When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish.
I’ll make sure that neither doubt nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness nor terror nor excitement nor discomfort nor excessive energy nor overly lax energy nor longing nor perception of diversity nor excessive concentration on forms will arise in me again.’
When I understood that doubt is a corruption of the mind, I gave it up.
When I understood that loss of focus,
dullness and drowsiness,
excitement,
discomfort,
excessive energy,
overly lax energy,
perception of diversity,
and excessive concentration on forms are corruptions of the mind, I gave them up.
While meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived light but did not see forms,
or I saw forms, but did not see light.
And this went on for a whole night, a whole day, even a whole night and day.
I thought:
‘What is the cause, what is the reason for this?’
It occurred to me:
‘When I don’t focus on the foundation of the forms, but focus on the foundation of the light, then I perceive light and do not see forms.
But when I don’t focus on the foundation of the light, but focus on the foundation of the forms, then I see forms and do not perceive light.
And this goes on for a whole night, a whole day, even a whole night and day.’
While meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, I perceived limited light and saw limited forms,
or I perceived limitless light and saw limitless forms.
And this went on for a whole night, a whole day, even a whole night and day.
I thought:
‘What is the cause, what is the reason for this?’
It occurred to me:
‘When my immersion is limited, then my vision is limited,
and with limited vision I perceive limited light and see limited forms.
But when my immersion is limitless, then my vision is limitless,
and with limitless vision I perceive limitless light and see limitless forms.
And this goes on for a whole night, a whole day, even a whole night and day.’
When I understood that doubt,
loss of focus,
dullness and drowsiness,
excitement,
discomfort,
excessive energy,
overly lax energy,
perception of diversity,
and excessive concentration on forms are corruptions of the mind, I gave them up.
I thought:
‘I’ve given up my mental corruptions.
Now let me develop immersion in three ways.’
I developed immersion while placing the mind and keeping it connected; without placing the mind, but just keeping it connected; without placing the mind or keeping it connected; with rapture; without rapture; with pleasure; with equanimity.
When I had developed immersion in these ways,
the knowledge and vision arose in me:
‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Anuruddha was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Dīghanakha
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain in the Boar’s Cave.
Then the wanderer Dīghanakha went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama, this is my doctrine and view:
‘I believe in nothing.’”
“This view of yours, Aggivessana—
do you believe in that?”
“If I believed in this view, Master Gotama, it wouldn’t make any difference, it wouldn’t make any difference!”
“Well, Aggivessana, there are many more in the world who say,
‘It wouldn’t make any difference! It wouldn’t make any difference!’
But they don’t give up that view, and they grasp another view.
And there are a scant few in the world who say,
‘It wouldn’t make any difference! It wouldn’t make any difference!’
And they give up that view by not grasping another view.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘I believe in everything.’
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘I believe in nothing.’
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘I believe in some things, and not in others.’
Regarding this, the view of the ascetics and brahmins who believe in everything
is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.
The view of the ascetics and brahmins who believe in nothing
is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.”
When he said this, the wanderer Dīghanakha said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama commends my conviction! He recommends my conviction!”
“Now, regarding the ascetics and brahmins who
believe in some things and not in others.
Their view of what they believe in is close to greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.
Their view of what they don’t believe in is far from greed, bondage, approving, attachment, and grasping.
When it comes to the view of the ascetics and brahmins who
believe in everything,
a sensible person reflects like this:
‘I have the view that
I believe in everything.
Suppose I obstinately stick to this view and insist that,
“This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.”
Then I’d argue with two people—
an ascetic or brahmin who believes in nothing,
and an ascetic or brahmin who believes in some things and not in others.
And when there’s arguing, there’s quarreling; when there’s quarreling there’s anguish; and when there’s anguish there’s harm.’
So, considering in themselves the potential for arguing, quarreling, anguish, and harm, they give up that view by not grasping another view.
That’s how those views are given up and let go.

Aggivessana, this body is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. You should see it as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.
Doing so, you’ll give up desire, affection, and subservience to the body.
There are these three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
At a time when you feel a pleasant feeling, you don’t feel a painful or neutral feeling;
you only feel a pleasant feeling.
At a time when you feel a painful feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or neutral feeling;
you only feel a painful feeling.
At a time when you feel a neutral feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or painful feeling;
you only feel a neutral feeling.
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away.
When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
A mendicant whose mind is freed like this doesn’t side with anyone or fight with anyone. They speak the language of the world without misapprehending it.”
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was standing behind the Buddha fanning him.
Then he thought,
“It seems the Buddha speaks of giving up and letting go all these things through direct knowledge.”
Reflecting like this, Venerable Sāriputta’s mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping.
And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the wanderer Dīghanakha:
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”
Then Dīghanakha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
The Mendicants of Kosambi
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Now at that time the mendicants of Kosambi were arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words.
They couldn’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor could they convince each other or be convinced.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell those mendicants that
the teacher summons them.
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said,
“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied.
They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them,
“Is it really true, mendicants, that you have been arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words?
And that you can’t persuade each other or be persuaded, nor can you convince each other or be convinced?”
“Yes, sir,” they said.
“What do you think, mendicants?
When you’re arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words, are you treating your spiritual companions with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private?”
“No, sir.”
“So it seems that when you’re arguing you are not treating each other with kindness.
So what exactly do you know and see, you foolish men, that you behave in such a way?
This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Mendicants, these six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
Firstly, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with bodily kindness, both in public and in private.
This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with verbal kindness …
Furthermore, a mendicant consistently treats their spiritual companions with mental kindness …
Furthermore, a mendicant shares without reservation any material possessions they have gained by legitimate means, even the food placed in the alms-bowl, using them in common with their ethical spiritual companions …
Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the precepts shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. Those precepts are unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. …
Furthermore, a mendicant lives according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private. That view is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering.
This warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
These six warm-hearted qualities make for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling.
Of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.
It’s like a bungalow. The roof-peak is the chief point, which holds and binds everything together.
In the same way, of these six warm-hearted qualities, the chief is the view that is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering. It holds and binds everything together.
And how does the view that is noble and emancipating lead one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering?
It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this,
‘Is there anything that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see?’
If a mendicant is overcome with sensual desire, it’s their mind that’s overcome.
If a mendicant is overcome with ill will,
dullness and drowsiness,
restlessness and remorse,
pursuing speculation about this world,
pursuing speculation about the next world,
or arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding others with barbed words, it’s their mind that’s overcome.
They understand,
‘There is nothing that I’m overcome with internally and haven’t given up, because of which I might not accurately know and see.
My mind is properly disposed for awakening to the truths.’
This is the first knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is not shared with ordinary people.
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,
‘When I develop, cultivate, and make much of this view, do I personally gain serenity and quenching?’
They understand,
‘When I develop, cultivate, and make much of this view, I personally gain serenity and quenching.’
This is their second knowledge …
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,
‘Are there any ascetics or brahmins outside of the Buddhist community who have the same kind of view that I have?’
They understand,
‘There are no ascetics or brahmins outside of the Buddhist community who have the same kind of view that I have.’
This is their third knowledge …
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,
‘Do I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view?’
And what, mendicants, is the nature of a person accomplished in view?
This is the nature of a person accomplished in view.
Though they may fall into a kind of offense for which rehabilitation has been laid down, they quickly disclose, clarify, and reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.
And having revealed it they restrain themselves in the future.
Suppose there was a little baby boy. If he puts his hand or foot on a burning coal, he quickly pulls it back.
In the same way, this is the nature of a person accomplished in view.
Though they may still fall into a kind of offense for which rehabilitation has been laid down, they quickly reveal it to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.
And having revealed it they restrain themselves in the future.
They understand,
‘I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view.’
This is their fourth knowledge …
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,
‘Do I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view?’
And what, mendicants, is the nature of a person accomplished in view?
This is the nature of a person accomplished in view.
Though they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom.
Suppose there was a cow with a baby calf. She keeps the calf close as she grazes.
In the same way, this is the nature of a person accomplished in view.
Though they might manage a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, they still feel a keen regard for the training in higher ethics, higher mind, and higher wisdom.
They understand,
‘I have the same nature as a person accomplished in view.’
This is their fifth knowledge …
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,
‘Do I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view?’
And what, mendicants, is the strength of a person accomplished in view?
The strength of a person accomplished in view is that, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, they pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear.
They understand,
‘I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view.’
This is their sixth knowledge …
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects,
‘Do I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view?’
And what, mendicants, is the strength of a person accomplished in view?
The strength of a person accomplished in view is that, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, they find joy in the meaning and the teaching, and find joy connected with the teaching.
They understand,
‘I have the same strength as a person accomplished in view.’
This is the seventh knowledge they have achieved that is noble and transcendent, and is not shared with ordinary people.
When a noble disciple has these seven factors, they have properly investigated their own nature with respect to the realization of the fruit of stream-entry.
A noble disciple with these seven factors has the fruit of stream-entry.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Man From the City of Aṭṭhaka
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.
Now at that time the householder Dasama from the city of Aṭṭhaka had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business.
He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying?
For I want to see him.”
“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.”
Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda.
He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda:
“Sir, Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary?”
“There is, householder.”
“And what is that one thing?”
“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Then they reflect:
‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’
They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption …
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.
In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
Then they reflect:
‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’
They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …
rejoicing …
equanimity …
Furthermore, householder, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
Then they reflect:
‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’
They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
Then they reflect:
‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’
They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’
Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary.”
When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Sir, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances!
In the same way, I was searching for the door to the deathless. And all at once I got to hear of eleven doors to the deathless.
Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors.
In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the deathless.
Sir, those who follow other paths seek a fee for the teacher. Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?”
Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
He clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda.
Middle Discourses
Conducive to the Imperturbable
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, and deceptive,
made by illusion, cooed over by fools.
Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;
both of these are Māra’s sovereignty, Māra’s domain, and Māra’s territory.
They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression.
And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here.
A noble disciple reflects on this:
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;
both of these are Māra’s sovereignty, Māra’s domain, and Māra’s territory.
They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression.
And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here.
Why don’t I meditate with an abundant, expansive heart, having mastered the world and stabilized the mind?
Then I will have no more bad, unskillful qualities such as desire, ill will, and aggression.
And by giving them up my mind, no longer limited, will become limitless and well developed.’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the imperturbable.
This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come;
whatever is form, all form is the four primary elements, or form derived from the four primary elements.’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the imperturbable.
This is said to be the second way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,
visions in this life and in lives to come,
perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come;
all of these are impermanent.
And what’s impermanent is not worth approving, welcoming, or clinging to.’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the imperturbable.
This is said to be the third way of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable.
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,
visions in this life and in lives to come,
perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come,
and perceptions of the imperturbable;
all are perceptions.
Where they cease without anything left over, that is peaceful, that is sublime,
namely the dimension of nothingness.’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the dimension of nothingness now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the dimension of nothingness.
This is said to be the first way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of nothingness.
Furthermore, a noble disciple has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this:
‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the dimension of nothingness now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the dimension of nothingness.
This is said to be the second way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of nothingness.
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the dimension of nothingness now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the dimension of nothingness.
This is said to be the third way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of nothingness.
Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects:
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,
visions in this life and in lives to come,
perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come,
perceptions of the imperturbable, and perceptions of the dimension of nothingness;
all are perceptions.
Where they cease without anything left over, that is peaceful, that is sublime,
namely the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’
Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension.
Being confident, they either attain the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception now, or are freed by wisdom.
When their body breaks up, after death, it’s possible that the consciousness headed that way will be reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is said to be the way of practice suitable for attaining the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:
“Sir, take a mendicant who practices like this:
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’
In this way they gain equanimity.
Would that mendicant become extinguished or not?”
“One such mendicant might become extinguished, Ānanda, while another might not.”
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for this?”
“Ānanda, take a mendicant who practices like this:
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’
In this way they gain equanimity.
They approve, welcome, and keep clinging to that equanimity.
Their consciousness relies on that and grasps it.
A mendicant with grasping does not become extinguished.”
“But sir, what is that mendicant grasping?”
“The dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”
“Sir, it seems that mendicant is grasping the best thing to grasp!”
“Indeed, Ānanda.
For the best thing to grasp is
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
Take a mendicant who practices like this:
‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’
In this way they gain equanimity.
They don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to that equanimity.
So their consciousness doesn’t rely on that and grasp it.
A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
The Buddha has explained to us how to cross over the flood by relying on one support or the other.
But sir, what is noble liberation?”
“Ananda, it’s when a mendicant reflects like this:
‘Sensual pleasures in this life and in lives to come,
sensual perceptions in this life and in lives to come,
visions in this life and in lives to come,
perceptions of visions in this life and in lives to come,
perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the dimension of nothingness, perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception;
that is identity as far as identity extends.
This is the deathless, namely the liberation of the mind through not grasping.
So, Ānanda, I have taught the ways of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught how to cross the flood by relying on one support or the other, and I have taught noble liberation.
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts.
Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Is This What You Think Of Me?
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusināra, in the Forest of Offerings.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, is this what you think of me?
‘The ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.’”
“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.”
“If you don’t think of me that way,
then what exactly do you think of me?”
“We think of you this way:
‘The Buddha is compassionate and wants what’s best for us.
He teaches out of compassion.’”
“So it seems you think
that I teach out of compassion.
In that case, each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is:
the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. You should train in these things in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling.
As you do so, it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teaching.
Now, you might think,
‘These two venerables disagree on both the meaning and the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them:
‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.
But the venerables should know that this is how
such disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to be.
Please don’t get into a fight about this.’
Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:
‘The venerables disagree on the meaning and the phrasing.
But the venerables should know that this is how
such disagreement on the meaning and the phrasing comes to be.
Please don’t get into a fight about this.’
So you should remember what has been incorrectly memorized as incorrectly memorized and what has been correctly memorized as correctly memorized.
Remembering this, you should speak on the teaching and the training.
Now, you might think,
‘These two venerables disagree on the meaning but agree on the phrasing.’ So you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable and say to them:
‘The venerables disagree on the meaning but agree on the phrasing.
But the venerables should know that this is how
such disagreement on the meaning and agreement on the phrasing comes to be.
Please don’t get into a fight about this.’
Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:
‘The venerables disagree on the meaning but agree on the phrasing.
But the venerables should know that this is how
such disagreement on the meaning and agreement on the phrasing comes to be.
Please don’t get into a fight about this.’
So you should remember what has been incorrectly memorized as incorrectly memorized and what has been correctly memorized as correctly memorized.

‘The venerables agree on the meaning but disagree on the phrasing.
But the venerables should know that this is how
such agreement on the meaning and disagreement on the phrasing comes to be.
But the phrasing is a minor matter.
Please don’t get into a fight about something so minor.’
Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:
‘The venerables agree on the meaning but disagree on the phrasing.
But the venerables should know that this is how
such agreement on the meaning and disagreement on the phrasing comes to be.
But the phrasing is a minor matter.
Please don’t get into a fight about something so minor.’
So you should remember what has been correctly memorized as correctly memorized and what has been incorrectly memorized as incorrectly memorized.

So you should remember what has been correctly memorized as correctly memorized.
Remembering this, you should speak on the teaching and the training.
As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, one of the mendicants might commit an offense or transgression.
In such a case, you should not be in a hurry to accuse them.
The individual should be examined like this:
‘I won’t be troubled and the other individual won’t be hurt, for they’re not irritable and hostile. They don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily. I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’
If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.
But suppose you think this:
‘I will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt, for they’re irritable and hostile. However, they don’t hold fast to their views, but let them go easily. I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.
But for the other individual to get hurt is a minor matter.
It’s more important
that I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’
If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.
But suppose you think this:
‘I will be troubled but the other individual won’t be hurt, for they’re not irritable and hostile.
However, they hold fast to their views, refusing to let go. Nevertheless, I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.
But for me to be troubled is a minor matter.
It’s more important
that I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’
If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.
But suppose you think this:
‘I will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt, for they’re irritable and hostile.
And they hold fast to their views, refusing to let go. Nevertheless, I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.
But for me to be troubled and the other individual to get hurt is a minor matter.
It’s more important
that I can draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’
If that’s what you think, then it’s appropriate to speak to them.
But suppose you think this:
‘I will be troubled and the other individual will be hurt, for they’re irritable and hostile.
And they hold fast to their views, refusing to let go. I cannot draw them away from the unskillful and establish them in the skillful.’
Don’t underestimate the value of equanimity for such a person.
As you train in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, mutual tale-bearing might come up, with contempt for each other’s views, resentful, bitter, and exasperated.
In this case you should approach whichever mendicant you think is most amenable among those who side with one party and say to them:
‘Reverend, as we were training, mutual tale-bearing came up. If the Ascetic knew about this, would he rebuke it?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:
‘Yes, reverend, he would.’
‘But without giving that up, reverend, can one realize extinguishment?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:
‘No, reverend, one cannot.’
Then they should approach whichever mendicant they think is most amenable among those who side with the other party and say to them:
‘Reverend, as we were training, mutual tale-bearing came up. If the Ascetic knew about this, would he rebuke it?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:
‘Yes, reverend, he would.’
‘But without giving that up, reverend, can one realize extinguishment?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:
‘No, reverend, one cannot.’
If others should ask that mendicant:
‘Were you the venerable who drew those mendicants away from the unskillful and established them in the skillful?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say:
‘Well, reverends, I approached the Buddha. He taught me the Dhamma. After hearing that teaching I explained it to those mendicants.
When those mendicants heard that teaching they were drawn away from the unskillful and established in the skillful.’
Answering in this way, that mendicant doesn’t glorify themselves or put others down. They answer in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse with Sakuludāyī
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.
They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Then it occurred to him,
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.
Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”
So the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.
Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as
talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.
Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,
and hushed his own assembly,
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
Here comes the ascetic Gotama.
The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”
Then those wanderers fell silent.
Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,
who said to him,
“Come, Blessed One!
Welcome, Blessed One!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,
while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.
It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.
Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them:
‘The people of Aṅga and Magadha are so fortunate, so very fortunate!
For there are these ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. And they have come down for the rainy season residence at Rājagaha.
They include Pūraṇa Kassapa,
Makkhali Gosāla,
Ajita Kesakambala,
Pakudha Kaccāyana,
Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta,
and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.
This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
And he too has come down for the rains residence at Rājagaha.
Which of these ascetics and brahmins is honored, respected, revered, and venerated by their disciples? And how do their disciples, after honoring and respecting them, remain loyal?’
Some of them said:
‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
But he’s not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by his disciples. And his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.
Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.
Then one of his disciples made a noise,
“My good sirs, don’t ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about that.
He doesn’t know that.
I know it. Ask me about it,
and I’ll answer you.”
It happened that Pūraṇa Kassapa didn’t get his way, though he called out with raised arms,
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
They’re not asking you, they’re asking me!
I’ll answer you!”
Indeed, many of his disciples have left him after refuting his doctrine:
“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training?
You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”
That’s how Pūraṇa Kassapa is not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by his disciples. On the contrary, his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.
Rather, he’s reviled, and rightly so.’
Others said:
'This Makkhali Gosāla …
Ajita Kesakambala …
Pakudha Kaccāyana …
Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta …
Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
But he’s not honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.
Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.
Then one of his disciples made a noise,
“My good sirs, don’t ask Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta about that.
He doesn’t know that.
I know it. Ask me about it,
and I’ll answer you.”
It happened that Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta didn’t get his way, though he called out with raised arms,
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
They’re not asking you, they’re asking me!
I’ll answer you!”
Indeed, many of his disciples have left him after refuting his doctrine:
“You don’t understand this teaching and training.
I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training?
You’re practicing wrong.
I’m practicing right.
I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!”
That’s how Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is not honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. On the contrary, his disciples, not honoring and respecting him, don’t remain loyal to him.
Rather, he’s reviled, and rightly so.’
Others said:
‘This ascetic Gotama leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people.
He’s honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And his disciples, honoring and respecting him, remain loyal to him.
Once it so happened that he was teaching an assembly of many hundreds.
Then one of his disciples cleared their throat.
And one of their spiritual companions nudged them with their knee, to indicate,
“Hush, venerable, don’t make sound! Our teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching!”
While the ascetic Gotama is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.
That large crowd is poised on the edge of their seats, thinking,
“Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.”
It’s like when there’s a person at the crossroads pressing out pure manuka honey,
and a large crowd is poised on the edge of their seats.
In the same way, while the ascetic Gotama is teaching an assembly of many hundreds, there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats.
That large crowd is poised on the edge of their seats, thinking,
“Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.”
Even when a disciple of the ascetic Gotama resigns the training and returns to a lesser life, having been overly attached to their spiritual companions, they speak only praise of the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They blame only themselves, not others: “We were unlucky, we had little merit. For even after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we weren’t able to practice for life the perfectly full and pure spiritual life.”
They become monastery workers or lay followers, and they proceed having undertaken the five precepts.
That’s how the ascetic Gotama is honored, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples. And that’s how his disciples, honoring and respecting him, remain loyal to him.’”
“But Udāyī, how many qualities do you see in me, because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and after honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me?”
“Sir, I see five such qualities in the Buddha.
What five?
The Buddha eats little and praises eating little.
This is the first such quality I see in the Buddha.
Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment.
This is the second such quality I see in the Buddha.
Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of almsfood, and praises such contentment.
This is the third such quality I see in the Buddha.
Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of lodging, and praises such contentment.
This is the fourth such quality I see in the Buddha.
Furthermore, the Buddha is secluded, and praises seclusion.
This is the fifth such quality I see in the Buddha.
These are the five qualities I see in the Buddha, because of which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate him; and after honoring and respecting him, they remain loyal to him.”
“Suppose, Udāyī, my disciples were loyal to me because I eat little. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat a cupful of food, or half a cupful; they eat a wood apple, or half a wood apple.
But sometimes I even eat this bowl full to the brim, or even more.
So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I eat little, then those disciples who eat even less would not be loyal to me.
Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe. Well, there are disciples of mine who have rag robes, wearing shabby robes. They gather scraps from charnel grounds, rubbish dumps, and shops, make them into a patchwork robe and wear it.
But sometimes I wear robes offered by householders that are strong, yet next to which bottle-gourd down is coarse.
So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe, then those disciples who wear rag robes would not be loyal to me.
Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of alms-food. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat only alms-food, wander indiscriminately for alms-food, happy to eat whatever they glean. When they’ve entered an inhabited area, they don’t consent when invited to sit down.
But sometimes I even eat by invitation boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces.
So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of alms-food, then those disciples who eat only alms-food would not be loyal to me.
Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging. Well, there are disciples of mine who stay at the root of a tree, in the open air. For eight months they don’t go under a roof.
But sometimes I even stay in bungalows, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered.
So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging, then those disciples who stay at the root of a tree would not be loyal to me.
Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m secluded and I praise seclusion. Well, there are disciples of mine who live in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. Having ventured deep into remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest, they live there, coming down to the midst of the Saṅgha each fortnight for the recitation of the monastic code.
But sometimes I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and teachers of other paths and their disciples.
So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m secluded and praise seclusion, then those disciples who live in the wilderness would not be loyal to me.
So, Udāyī, it’s not because of these five qualities that my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and after honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.
There are five other qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and after honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.
What five?
Firstly, my disciples esteem me for the higher ethics:
‘The ascetic Gotama is ethical. He possesses the entire spectrum of ethical conduct to the highest degree.’
Since this is so,
this is the first quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.
Furthermore, my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and vision:
‘The ascetic Gotama only claims to know when he does in fact know.
He only claims to see when he really does see.
He teaches based on direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge.
He teaches based on reason, not without reason.
He teaches with a demonstrable basis, not without it.’
Since this is so,
this is the second quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.
Furthermore, my disciples esteem me for my higher wisdom:
‘The ascetic Gotama is wise. He possesses the entire spectrum of wisdom to the highest degree.
It’s not possible that he would fail to foresee grounds for future criticism, or to legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up.’
What do you think, Udāyī?
Would my disciples, knowing and seeing this, break in and interrupt me?”
“No, sir.”
“That’s because I don’t expect to be instructed by my disciples.
Invariably, my disciples expect instruction from me.
Since this is so,
this is the third quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.
Furthermore, my disciples come to me and ask how the noble truth of suffering applies to the suffering in which they are swamped and mired. And I provide them with a satisfying answer to their question.
They ask how the noble truths of the origin of suffering,
the cessation of suffering,
and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering apply to the suffering that has overwhelmed them and brought them low. And I provide them with satisfying answers to their questions.
Since this is so,
this is the fourth quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four right efforts.
It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise.
They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four bases of psychic power.
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort.
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort.
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort.
They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the five faculties.
It’s when a mendicant develops the faculties of faith,
mindfulness,
immersion,
and wisdom, which lead to peace and awakening.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the five powers.
It’s when a mendicant develops the powers of faith,
mindfulness,
immersion,
and wisdom, which lead to peace and awakening.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the seven awakening factors.
It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,
investigation of principles,
tranquility,
immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the noble eightfold path.
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the eight liberations.
Having physical form, they see visions.
This is the first liberation.
Not perceiving form internally, they see visions externally.
This is the second liberation.
They’re focused only on beauty.
This is the third liberation.
Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.
This is the fourth liberation.
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
This is the fifth liberation.
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.
This is the sixth liberation.
Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is the seventh liberation.
Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.
This is the eighth liberation.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the eight dimensions of mastery.
Perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limited, both pretty and ugly.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the first dimension of mastery.
Perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the second dimension of mastery.
Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limited, both pretty and ugly.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the third dimension of mastery.
Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the fourth dimension of mastery.
Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint.
They’re like a flax flower that’s blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that’s smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint.
In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the fifth dimension of mastery.
Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint.
They’re like a champak flower that’s yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that’s smoothed on both sides, yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint.
In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the sixth dimension of mastery.
Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are red, with red color, red hue, and red tint.
They’re like a scarlet mallow flower that’s red, with red color, red hue, and red tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that’s smoothed on both sides, red, with red color, red hue, and red tint.
In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are red, with red color, red hue, and red tint.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the seventh dimension of mastery.
Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are white, with white color, white hue, and white tint.
They’re like the morning star that’s white, with white color, white hue, and white tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that’s smoothed on both sides, white, with white color, white hue, and white tint.
In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are white, with white color, white hue, and white tint.
Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’
This is the eighth dimension of mastery.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the ten universal dimensions of meditation.
Someone perceives the meditation on universal earth above, below, across, non-dual and limitless.
They perceive the meditation on universal water …
the meditation on universal fire …
the meditation on universal air …
the meditation on universal blue …
the meditation on universal yellow …
the meditation on universal red …
the meditation on universal white …
the meditation on universal space …
the meditation on universal consciousness above, below, across, non-dual and limitless.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to develop the four absorptions.
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.
It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out.
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.
It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water.
There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time.
But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water.
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion.
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water.
In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture.
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.
It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth.
In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this:
‘This body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.
And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’
Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent and clear, endowed with all good qualities.
And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.
And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and check it:
‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent and clear, endowed with all good qualities.
And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand this:
‘This body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.
And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body, consisting of form, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty.
Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath.
They’d think:
‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’
Or suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard.
They’d think:
‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’
Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough.
They’d think:
‘This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake and the slough are different things. The snake has been drawn out from the slough.’
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to create from this body another body, consisting of form, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
Suppose a deft potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like.
Or suppose a deft ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like.
Or suppose a deft goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like.
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to wield the many kinds of psychic power …
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four directions.
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’;
mind with hate as ‘mind with hate’,
and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate’;
mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion’,
and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion’;
constricted mind as ‘constricted mind’,
and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind’;
expansive mind as ‘expansive mind’,
and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind’;
mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme’,
and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme’;
mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi’,
and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi’;
freed mind as ‘freed mind’,
and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot’, and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots’.
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind …
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.
‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think:
‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to recollect the many kinds of past lives.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds:
‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
Suppose there were two houses with doors.
A person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use so that, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn …
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
Furthermore, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
Suppose there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded.
A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think:
‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’
In the same way, I have explained to my disciples a practice that they use to realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
And many of my disciples meditate on that having attained perfection and consummation of insight.
This is the fifth quality because of which my disciples are loyal to me.
These are the five qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and after honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the wanderer Sakuludāyī was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Right View
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:
“Reverends, mendicants!”
“Reverend,” they replied.
Sāriputta said this:
“Reverends, they speak of this thing called ‘right view’.
How do you define a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”
“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.
The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Sāriputta said this:
“A noble disciple understands the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.
But what is the unskillful and what is its root? And what is the skillful and what is its root?
Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and covetousness, ill will, and wrong view.
This is called the unskillful.
And what is the root of the unskillful?
Greed, hate, and delusion.
This is called the root of the unskillful.
And what is the skillful?
Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, good will, and right view.
This is called the skillful.
And what is the root of the skillful?
Contentment, love, and understanding.
This is called the root of the skillful.
A noble disciple understands in this way the unskillful and its root, and the skillful and its root. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”
Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then they asked another question:
“But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”
“There might, reverends.
A noble disciple understands fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.
But what is fuel? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?
There are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.
What four?
Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.
Fuel originates from craving. Fuel ceases when craving ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of fuel is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
A noble disciple understands in this way fuel, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”
Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants … asked another question:
“But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching?”
“There might, reverends.
A noble disciple understands suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching.
But what is suffering? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?
Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.
This is called suffering.
And what is the origin of suffering?
It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different realms. That is,
craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence.
This is called the origin of suffering.
And what is the cessation of suffering?
It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it.
This is called the cessation of suffering.
And what is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view … right immersion.
This is called the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.
A noble disciple understands in this way suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”
Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants … asked another question:
“But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who … has come to the true teaching?”
“There might, reverends.
A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation …
But what are old age and death? What is their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation?
The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, gray hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age.
And what is death?
The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, laying to rest of the corpse, and cutting off of the life faculty of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called death.
Such is old age, and such is death.
This is called old age and death.
Old age and death originate from rebirth. Old age and death cease when rebirth ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death is simply this noble eightfold path …”
“Might there be another way to describe a noble disciple?”
“There might, reverends.
A noble disciple understands rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation …

The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the aggregates, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called rebirth.
Rebirth originates from continued existence. Rebirth ceases when continued existence ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of rebirth is simply this noble eightfold path …”

Saying “Good, sir,” those mendicants approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said. Then they asked another question:
“But reverend, might there be another way to describe a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching?”
“There might, reverends.
A noble disciple understands defilement, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.
But what is defilement? What is its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation?
There are these three defilements.
The defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
Defilement originates from ignorance. Defilement ceases when ignorance ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of defilement is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
A noble disciple understands in this way defilement, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. They’ve completely given up the underlying tendency to greed, got rid of the underlying tendency to repulsion, and eradicated the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am’. They’ve given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, and make an end of suffering in this very life.
When they’ve done this, they’re defined as a noble disciple who has right view, whose view is correct, who has experiential confidence in the teaching, and has come to the true teaching.”
This is what Venerable Sāriputta said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said.
Middle Discourses
The Development of the Faculties
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo grove.
Then the brahmin student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya, approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?”
“He does, Master Gotama.”
“But how does he teach it?”
“Master Gotama, it’s when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound.
That’s how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.”
“In that case, Uttara, a blind person and a deaf person will have developed faculties
according to what Pārāsariya says.
For a blind person sees no sight with the eye and a deaf person hears no sound with the ear.”
When he said this, Uttara sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, the development of the faculties taught by Pārāsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.”
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One.
Let the Buddha teach the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.
The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And how, Ānanda, is there the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One?
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They understand:
‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me.
That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated.
But this is peaceful and sublime, namely
equanimity.’
Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease,
and equanimity becomes stabilized.
It’s like how a person with good sight might open their eyes then shut them; or might shut their eyes then open them.
Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.
In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sights known by the eye.
Furthermore, when a mendicant hears a sound with their ears, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They understand:
‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me.
That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated.
But this is peaceful and sublime, namely
equanimity.’
Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease,
and equanimity becomes stabilized.
It’s like how a strong person can effortlessly snap their fingers.
Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.
In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sounds known by the ear.
Furthermore, when a mendicant smells an odor with their nose, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They understand:
‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me.
That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated.
But this is peaceful and sublime, namely
equanimity.’
Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease,
and equanimity becomes stabilized.
It’s like how a drop of water would roll off a gently sloping lotus leaf, and would not stay there.
Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.
In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding smells known by the nose.
Furthermore, when a mendicant tastes a flavor with their tongue, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They understand:
‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me.
That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated.
But this is peaceful and sublime, namely
equanimity.’
Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease,
and equanimity becomes stabilized.
It’s like how a strong person who’s formed a glob of spit on the tip of their tongue could easily spit it out.
Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.
In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding tastes known by the tongue.
Furthermore, when a mendicant feels a touch with their body, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They understand:
‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me.
That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated.
But this is peaceful and sublime, namely
equanimity.’
Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease,
and equanimity becomes stabilized.
It’s like how a strong person can extend or contract their arm.
Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.
In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding touches known by the body.
Furthermore, when a mendicant knows a thought with their mind, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They understand:
‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me.
That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated.
But this is peaceful and sublime, namely
equanimity.’
Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease,
and equanimity becomes stabilized.
It’s like how a strong person could let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron cauldron that had been heated all day.
The drops would be slow to fall, but they’d quickly dry up and evaporate.
Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized.
In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding thoughts known by the mind.
That’s how there is the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.
And how are they a practicing trainee?
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They are horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
They are horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that.
That’s how they are a practicing trainee.
And how are they a noble one with developed faculties?
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
When they hear a sound with their ear …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.
If they wish:
‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.
That’s how they are a noble one with developed faculties.
So, Ānanda, I have taught the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One, I have taught the practicing trainee, and I have taught the noble one with developed faculties.
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts.
Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
The Middle Discourses is completed.
Middle Discourses
The Simile of the Snake
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭtha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception:
“As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”
Several mendicants heard about this.
They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him,
“Is it really true, Reverend Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:
‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”
“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”
Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him,
“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.
In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.
The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
With the similes of a skeleton …
a lump of meat …
a grass torch …
a pit of glowing coals …
borrowed goods …
fruit on a tree …
a butcher’s knife and chopping block …
a staking sword …
a snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”
But even though the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on stating it.
When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture trapper, that
the teacher summons him.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ariṭṭha and said to him,
“Reverend Ariṭṭha, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” Ariṭṭha replied.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“Is it really true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a harmful misconception:
‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?”
“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.”
“Silly man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way?
Haven’t I said in many ways that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them?
I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
With the similes of a skeleton …
a lump of meat …
a grass torch …
a pit of glowing coals …
borrowed goods …
fruit on a tree …
a butcher’s knife and chopping block …
a staking sword …
a snake’s head, I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and make much bad karma.
This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“What do you think, mendicants?
Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of wisdom in this teaching and training?”
“How could that be, sir?
When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
Knowing this, the Buddha said,
“Silly man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception.
I’ll question the mendicants about this.”
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Ariṭṭha does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma?”
For in many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them.
The Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
With the similes of a skeleton …
a snake’s head, the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.”
“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.
For in many ways I have said that obstructive acts are obstructive …
I’ve said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
But still this Ariṭṭha misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma.
This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.
Truly, mendicants, it’s not possible to perform sensual acts without sensual pleasures, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts.
Take a foolish person who memorizes the teaching—
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
But they don’t examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom,
and so don’t come to a considered acceptance of them.
They just memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates.
They don’t realize the goal for which they memorized them.
Because they’re wrongly grasped, those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering.
Why is that?
Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.
Suppose there was a person in need of a snake. And while wandering in search of a snake
they’d see a big snake,
and grasp it by the coil or the tail.
But that snake would twist back and bite them on the hand or the arm or limb,
resulting in death or deadly pain.
Why is that?
Because of their wrong grasp of the snake.
In the same way, a foolish person memorizes the teaching …
and those teachings lead to their lasting harm and suffering.
Why is that?
Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings.
Now, take a gentleman who memorizes the teaching—
statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications.
And once he’s memorized them, he examines their meaning with wisdom,
and comes to a considered acceptance of them.
He doesn’t memorize the teaching for the sake of finding fault and winning debates.
He realizes the goal for which he memorized them.
Because they’re correctly grasped, those teachings lead to his lasting welfare and happiness.
Why is that?
Because of his correct grasp of the teachings.
Suppose there was a person in need of a snake. And while wandering in search of a snake
they’d see a big snake,
and hold it down carefully with a cleft stick.
Only then would they correctly grasp it by the neck.
And even though that snake might wrap its coils around that person’s hand or arm or some other limb, that wouldn’t result in death or deadly pain.
Why is that?
Because of their correct grasp of the snake.
In the same way, a gentleman memorizes the teaching …
and those teachings lead to his lasting welfare and happiness.
Why is that?
Because of his correct grasp of the teachings.
So, mendicants, when you understand what I’ve said, you should remember it accordingly.
But if I’ve said anything that you don’t understand, you should ask me about it, or some competent mendicants.
Mendicants, I will teach you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft: it’s for crossing over, not for holding on.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Suppose there was a person traveling along the road.
They’d see a large deluge, whose near shore was dubious and perilous, while the far shore was a sanctuary free of peril.
But there was no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over.
They’d think,
‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’
And so they’d do exactly that.
And when they’d crossed over to the far shore, they’d think,
‘This raft has been very helpful to me.
Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I have safely crossed over to the far shore.
Why don’t I hoist it on my head or pick it up on my shoulder and go wherever I want?’
What do you think, mendicants?
Would that person be doing what should be done with that raft?”
“No, sir.”
“And what, mendicants, should that person do with the raft?
When they’d crossed over they should think,
‘This raft has been very helpful to me. …
Why don’t I beach it on dry land or set it adrift on the water and go wherever I want?’
That’s what that person should do with the raft.
In the same way, I have taught how the teaching is similar to a raft: it’s for crossing over, not for holding on.
By understanding the simile of the raft, you will even give up the teachings, let alone what is against the teachings.
Mendicants, there are these six grounds for views.
Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’
They also regard feeling …
perception …
whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’
And the same for this ground for views:
‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’
They also regard this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’
But an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
They also regard feeling …
perception …
whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
And the same for this ground for views:
‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’
They also regard this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing in this way they’re not anxious about what doesn’t exist.”
When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
“Sir, can there be anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally?”
“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.
“It’s when someone thinks,
‘Oh, but it used to be mine, and it is mine no more.
Oh, but it could be mine, and I will get it no more.’
They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
That’s how there is anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally.”
“But can there be no anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally?”
“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.
“It’s when someone doesn’t think,
‘Oh, but it used to be mine, and it is mine no more.
Oh, but it could be mine, and I will get it no more.’
They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
That’s how there is no anxiety about what doesn’t exist externally.”
“But can there be anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally?”
“There can, mendicant,” said the Buddha.
“It’s when someone has such a view:
‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’
They hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds, fixations, obsessions, insistences, and underlying tendencies regarding views; for the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
They think,
‘Whoa, I’m going to be annihilated and destroyed! I won’t exist any more!’
They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
That’s how there is anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally.”
“But can there be no anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally?”
“There can,” said the Buddha.
“It’s when someone doesn’t have such a view:
‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’
They hear the Realized One or their disciple teaching Dhamma for the uprooting of all grounds, fixations, obsessions, insistences, and underlying tendencies regarding views; for the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
It never occurs to them,
‘Whoa, I’m going to be annihilated and destroyed! I won’t exist any more!’
They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
That’s how there is no anxiety about what doesn’t exist internally.
Mendicants, it would make sense to be possessive about something that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.
But do you see any such possession?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
I also can’t see any such possession.
It would make sense to grasp at a doctrine of self that didn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
But do you see any such doctrine of self?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
I also can’t see any such doctrine of self.
It would make sense to rely on a view that didn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
But do you see any such view to rely on?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
I also can’t see any such view to rely on.
Mendicants, were a self to exist, would there be the thought, ‘Belonging to my self’?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Were what belongs to a self to exist, would there be the thought, ‘My self’?”
“Yes, sir.”
“But self and what belongs to a self are not acknowledged as a genuine fact. This being so, is not the following a totally foolish teaching:
‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After death I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever’?”
“What else could it be, sir? It’s a totally foolish teaching.”
“What do you think, mendicants?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“What do you think, mendicants?
Is feeling …
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“So, mendicants, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
You should truly see any kind of feeling …
perception …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
This is called a mendicant who has lifted up the cross-bar, filled in the trench, and pulled up the pillar; who is unbarred, a noble one with banner and burden put down, detached.
And how has a mendicant lifted the cross-bar?
It’s when a mendicant has given up ignorance, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant has lifted the cross-bar.
And how has a mendicant filled in the trench?
It’s when a mendicant has given up transmigrating through births in future lives, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant has filled in the trench.
And how has a mendicant pulled up the pillar?
It’s when a mendicant has given up craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant has pulled up the pillar.
And how is a mendicant unbarred?
It’s when a mendicant has given up the five lower fetters, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant is unbarred.
And how is a mendicant a noble one with banner and burden put down, detached?
It’s when a mendicant has given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That’s how a mendicant is a noble one with banner and burden put down, detached.
When a mendicant’s mind is freed like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and Pajāpati, search as they may, will not find
anything that such a Realized One’s consciousness depends on.
Why is that?
Because even in the present life the Realized One is undiscoverable, I say.
Though I speak and explain like this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim:
‘The ascetic Gotama is an exterminator. He advocates the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being.’
I have been falsely misrepresented as being what I am not, and saying what I do not say.
In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.
This being so, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the Realized One, he doesn’t get resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated.
Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate him, he doesn’t get thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited.
He just thinks,
‘They do such things for what has already been completely understood.’
So, mendicants, if others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble you, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and emotionally exasperated.
Or if others honor, respect, revere, or venerate you, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and emotionally excited.
Just think,
‘They do such things for what has already been completely understood.’
So, mendicants, give up what isn't yours.
Giving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.
And what isn’t yours?
Form isn’t yours: give it up.
Giving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.
perception …
consciousness isn’t yours: give it up.
Giving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.
What do you think, mendicants?
Suppose a person was to carry off the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in this Jeta’s Grove, or burn them, or do what they want with them.
Would you think,
‘This person is carrying us off, burning us, or doing what they want with us?’”
Why is that?
Because that’s neither self nor belonging to self.”
“In the same way, mendicants, give up what isn't yours.
Giving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.
And what isn’t yours?
perception …
consciousness isn’t yours: give it up.
Giving it up will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.
Thus the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened, illuminated, and stripped of patchwork.
In this teaching there are mendicants who are perfected, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. For them, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found. …
In this teaching there are mendicants who have given up the five lower fetters. All of them are reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. …
In this teaching there are mendicants who, having given up three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners. All of them come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. …
In this teaching there are mendicants who have ended three fetters. All of them are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. …
In this teaching there are mendicants who are followers of principles, or followers by faith. All of them are bound for awakening.
Thus the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened, illuminated, and stripped of patchwork.
In this teaching there are those who have a degree of faith and love for me. All of them are bound for heaven.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Analysis of a Recitation Passage
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of a recitation passage.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“A mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally, and they are not anxious because of grasping.
When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.”
That is what the Buddha said.
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail.
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha?”
Then those mendicants thought,
“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”
Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.
They told him what had happened, and said,
“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.”
“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.
Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you passed him by, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.
Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”
“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahākaccāna said this:
“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
‘A mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally, and they are not anxious because of grasping. When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.’
And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
And how is consciousness scattered and diffused externally?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. Their consciousness follows after the features of that sight, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features. So their consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, their consciousness follows after the features of that thought, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features. So their consciousness is said to be scattered and diffused externally.
That’s how consciousness is scattered and diffused externally.
And how is consciousness not scattered and diffused externally?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. Their consciousness doesn’t follow after the features of that sight, and is not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features. So their consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externally.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, their consciousness doesn’t follow after the features of that thought, and is not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in its features. So their consciousness is said to be not scattered and diffused externally.
That’s how consciousness is not scattered and diffused externally.
And how is their consciousness stuck internally?
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Their consciousness follows after that rapture and bliss born of seclusion, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of seclusion. So their mind is said to be stuck internally.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Their consciousness follows after that rapture and bliss born of immersion, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of immersion. So their mind is said to be stuck internally.
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Their consciousness follows after that equanimity, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that equanimous bliss. So their mind is said to be stuck internally.
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
Their consciousness follows after that neutral feeling, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling. So their mind is said to be stuck internally.
That’s how their consciousness is stuck internally.
And how is their consciousness not stuck internally?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Their consciousness doesn’t follow after that rapture and bliss born of seclusion, and is not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that rapture and bliss born of seclusion. So their mind is said to be not stuck internally.
Furthermore, they enter the second absorption …
Their consciousness doesn’t follow after that rapture and bliss born of immersion …
Furthermore, they enter and remain in the third absorption …
Their consciousness doesn’t follow after that equanimity, and is not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that equanimous bliss. So their mind is said to be not stuck internally.
Furthermore, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption …
Their consciousness doesn’t follow after that neutral feeling, and is not tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling. So their mind is said to be not stuck internally.
That’s how their consciousness is not stuck internally.
And how are they anxious because of grasping?
It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
But that form of theirs decays and perishes,
and consciousness latches on to the perishing of form.
Anxieties occupy their mind, born of latching on to the perishing of form, and originating in accordance with natural principles.
So they become frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping.
They regard feeling …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes,
and consciousness latches on to the perishing of consciousness.
Anxieties occupy their mind, born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness, and originating in accordance with natural principles.
So they become frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping.
That’s how they are anxious because of grasping.
And how are they not anxious because of grasping?
It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
When that form of theirs decays and perishes,
consciousness doesn’t latch on to the perishing of form.
Anxieties—born of latching on to the perishing of form and originating in accordance with natural principles—don’t occupy their mind.
So they don’t become frightened, worried, concerned, or anxious because of grasping.
They don’t regard feeling …
perception …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
When that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes,
consciousness doesn’t latch on to the perishing of consciousness.
Anxieties—born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness and originating in accordance with natural principles—don’t occupy their mind.
So they don’t become frightened, worried, concerned, or anxious because of grasping.
That’s how they are not anxious because of grasping.
The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
‘A mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally, and they are not anxious because of grasping.
When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.’
And this is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Yes, reverend,” said those mendicants, approving and agreeing with what Mahākaccāna said.
Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, saying:
“Mahākaccāna clearly explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”
“Mahākaccāna is astute, mendicants, he has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Bhaddāli
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I eat my food in one sitting per day.
Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
You too should eat your food in one sitting per day.
Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”
When he said this, Venerable Bhaddāli said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I’m not going to try to eat my food in one sitting per day.
For when eating once a day I might feel remorse and regret.”
“Well then, Bhaddāli, eat one part of the meal in the place where you’re invited, and bring the rest back to eat.
Eating this way, too, you will sustain yourself.”
“Sir, I’m not going to try to eat that way, either.
For when eating that way I might also feel remorse and regret.”
Then, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, Bhaddāli announced he would not try to keep it.
Then for the whole of that three months Bhaddāli did not present himself in the presence of the Buddha, as happens when someone doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering.
Then Bhaddāli went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
The mendicants said to Bhaddāli,
“Reverend Bhaddāli, this robe is being made for the Buddha.
When it’s finished and the three months of the rains residence have passed the Buddha will set out wandering.
Come on, Bhaddāli, learn your lesson. Don’t make it hard for yourself later on.”
“Yes, reverends,” Bhaddāli replied.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, you announced you would not try to keep it.
And you didn’t realize this situation:
‘The Buddha is staying in Sāvatthī, and he’ll know me
as the mendicant named Bhaddāli who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.’
And you didn’t realize this situation:
‘Several monks have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī …
several nuns have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī …
several laymen reside in Sāvatthī …
several laywomen reside in Sāvatthī, and they’ll know me
as the mendicant named Bhaddāli who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions. …
Several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths have commenced the rains retreat in Sāvatthī, and they’ll know me
as the mendicant named Bhaddāli, one of the senior disciples of Gotama, who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.’
You also didn’t realize this situation.”
“I made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, I announced I would not try to keep it.
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you that, as this rule was being laid down by the Buddha and the Saṅgha was undertaking it, you announced you would not try to keep it.
What do you think, Bhaddāli?
Suppose I was to say this to a mendicant who is freed both ways:
‘Please, mendicant, be a bridge for me to cross over the mud.’ Would they cross over themselves, or struggle to get out of it, or just say no?”
“No, sir.”
“What do you think, Bhaddāli?
Suppose I was to say the same thing to a mendicant who is freed by wisdom,
or a personal witness,
or attained to view,
or freed by faith,
or a follower of the teachings,
or a follower by faith:
‘Please, mendicant, be a bridge for me to cross over the mud.’ Would they cross over themselves, or struggle to get out of it, or just say no?”
“No, sir.”
“What do you think, Bhaddāli?
At that time were you freed both ways, freed by wisdom, a personal witness, attained to view, freed by faith, a follower of the teachings, or a follower by faith?”
“No, sir.”
“Weren’t you void, hollow, and mistaken?”
“Yes, sir.”
“I made a mistake, sir. …
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, Bhaddāli, you made a mistake. …
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.
Bhaddāli, take a mendicant who doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
They think,
‘Why don’t I frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
Hopefully I’ll realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.’
So they frequent a secluded lodging.
While they’re living withdrawn, they’re reprimanded by the Teacher, by sensible spiritual companions after examination, by deities, and by themselves.
Being reprimanded in this way, they don’t realize any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
Why is that?
Because that’s how it is when someone doesn’t fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
But take a mendicant who does fulfill the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
They think,
‘Why don’t I frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
Hopefully I’ll realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.’
They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.
While they’re living withdrawn, they’re not reprimanded by the Teacher, by sensible spiritual companions after examination, by deities, or by themselves.
Not being reprimanded in this way, they realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.
They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds:
‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. … They’re reborn in the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. … they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman … they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
Why is that?
Because that’s what happens when someone fulfills the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.”
When he said this, Venerable Bhaddāli said to the Buddha,
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why they punish some monk, repeatedly pressuring him?
And what is the cause, what is the reason why they don’t similarly punish another monk, repeatedly pressuring him?”
“Take a monk who is a frequent offender with many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. He displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He doesn’t proceed properly, he doesn’t fall in line, he doesn’t proceed to get past it, and he doesn’t say: ‘I’ll do what pleases the Saṅgha.’
In such a case, the monks say:
‘Reverends, this monk is a frequent offender, with many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. He displays annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He doesn’t proceed properly, he doesn’t fall in line, he doesn’t proceed to get past it, and he doesn’t say: “I’ll do what pleases the Saṅgha.”
It’d be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is not quickly settled.’
And that’s what they do.
Take some other monk who is a frequent offender with many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he doesn’t dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. He doesn’t display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He proceeds properly, he falls in line, he proceeds to get past it, and he says: ‘I’ll do what pleases the Saṅgha.’
In such a case, the monks say:
‘Reverends, this monk is a frequent offender, with many offenses.

It’d be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is quickly settled.’
And that’s what they do.
Take some other monk who is an occasional offender without many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue …
In such a case, the monks say:
‘Reverends, this monk is an occasional offender without many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he dodges the issue …
It’d be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is not quickly settled.’
And that’s what they do.
Take some other monk who is an occasional offender without many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he doesn’t dodge the issue …
In such a case, the monks say:
‘Reverends, this monk is an occasional offender without many offenses.
When admonished by the monks, he doesn’t dodge the issue …
It’d be good for the venerables to examine this monk in such a way that this disciplinary issue is quickly settled.’
And that’s what they do.
Take some other monk who gets by with mere faith and love.
In such a case, the monks say:
‘Reverends, this monk gets by with mere faith and love.
If we punish him, repeatedly pressuring him—
no, let him not lose what little faith and love he has!’
Suppose there was a person with one eye. Their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would protect that one eye:
‘Let them not lose the one eye that they have!’
In the same way, some monk gets by with mere faith and love.
In such a case, the monks say:
‘Reverends, this monk gets by with mere faith and love.
If we punish him, repeatedly pressuring him—
no, let him not lose what little faith and love he has!’
This is the cause, this is the reason why they punish some monk, repeatedly pressuring him.
And this is the cause, this is the reason why they don’t similarly punish another monk, repeatedly pressuring him.”
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants?
And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?”
“That’s how it is, Bhaddāli. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants.
The Teacher doesnʼt lay down training rules for disciples as long as certain defiling influences have not appeared in the Saṅgha.
But when such defiling influences appear in the Saṅgha, the Teacher lays down training rules for disciples to protect against them.
And they donʼt appear until the Saṅgha has attained a great size,
an abundance of material support and fame, learning, and seniority.
But when the Saṅgha has attained these things, then such defiling influences appear in the Saṅgha, and the Teacher lays down training rules for disciples to protect against them.
There were only a few of you there at the time when I taught the exposition of the teaching on the simile of the thoroughbred colt.
Do you remember that, Bhaddāli?”
“No, sir.”
“What do you believe the reason for that is?”
“Sir, it’s surely because for a long time now I haven’t fulfilled the training according to the Teacher’s instructions.”
“That’s not the only reason, Bhaddāli.
Rather, for a long time I have comprehended your mind and known:
‘While I’m teaching, this silly man doesn’t pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, or lend an ear.’
Still, Bhaddāli, I shall teach the exposition of the teaching on the simile of the thoroughbred colt.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Bhaddāli replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.
Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some tricks, dodges, and evasions.
But with regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habit.
When it has done this, the horse trainer next makes it get used to wearing the harness.
Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some tricks, dodges, and evasions.
But with regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habit.
When it has done this, the horse trainer next makes it get used to walking in procession, circling, prancing, galloping, charging, the protocols and traditions of court, and in the very best speed, fleetness, and friendliness.
Because it has not done this before, it still resorts to some tricks, dodges, and evasions.
But with regular and gradual practice it quells that bad habit.
When it has done this, the horse trainer next rewards it with a grooming and a rub down.
A fine royal thoroughbred with these ten factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.
In the same way, a mendicant with ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.
It’s when a mendicant has an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom.
A mendicant with these ten qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Bhaddāli was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Noble Search
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him,
“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.
It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”
“Well then, reverends, go to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.
Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, the Buddha addressed Ānanda,
“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother for the day’s meditation.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery.
In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda,
“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe.
When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself.
Then Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby.
It’s so delightful,
so lovely.
Please visit it out of compassion.”
The Buddha consented in silence.
He went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage.
Now at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teaching.
The Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.
When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked with the latch.
The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha,
and he entered the hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out
and addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now?
What conversation was unfinished?”
“Sir, our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrived.”
“Good, mendicants!
It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together and talk about the teaching.
When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things:
discuss the teachings or keep noble silence.
Mendicants, there are these two searches:
the noble search and the ignoble search.
And what is the ignoble search?
It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things.
And what should be described as liable to be reborn?
Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to be reborn.
These attachments are liable to be reborn.
Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to being reborn, seeks what is also liable to be reborn.
And what should be described as liable to grow old?
Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to grow old.
These attachments are liable to grow old.
Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to grow old, seeks what is also liable to grow old.
And what should be described as liable to fall sick?
Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to fall sick.
These attachments are liable to fall sick.
Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to falling sick, seeks what is also liable to fall sick.
And what should be described as liable to die?
Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to die.
These attachments are liable to die.
Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to die, seeks what is also liable to die.
And what should be described as liable to sorrow?
Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to sorrow.
These attachments are liable to sorrow.
Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to sorrow, seeks what is also liable to sorrow.
And what should be described as liable to corruption?
Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and money are liable to corruption.
These attachments are liable to corruption.
Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to corruption, seeks what is also liable to corruption.
This is the ignoble search.
And what is the noble search?
It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, seeks the unborn supreme sanctuary, extinguishment. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment.
This is the noble search.
Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too, being liable to be reborn, sought what is also liable to be reborn. Myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, I sought what is also liable to these things.
Then it occurred to me:
‘Why do I, being liable to be reborn, grow old, fall sick, sorrow, die, and become corrupted, seek things that have the same nature?
Why don’t I seek the unborn, unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment?’
Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace.
I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,
‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’
Āḷāra Kālāma replied,
‘Stay, venerable.
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’
I quickly memorized that teaching.
So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”
Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’
So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,
‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’
When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith,
mindfulness,
immersion,
and wisdom; I too have these things.
Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.
So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him,
‘Reverend Kālāma, have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point, and declare having achieved it?’
‘I have, reverend.’
‘I too, reverend, have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’
‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!
So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it.
The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it.
So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching that you know, I know.
I am like you and you are like me.
Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’
And that is how my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his student, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.
I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him,
‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’
Uddaka replied,
‘Stay, venerable.
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’
I quickly memorized that teaching.
So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.”
Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching.’
So I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him,
‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’
When I said this, Uddaka, son of Rāma, declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
Then it occurred to me,
‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith,
mindfulness,
immersion,
and wisdom; I too have these things.
Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it.
So I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him,
‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’
‘He had, reverend.’
‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’
‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions!
So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it.
The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it.
So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew.
Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma.
Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’
And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka, son of Rāma, placed me in the position of a teacher, and honored me with lofty praise.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed.
I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā.
There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to go for alms.
Then it occurred to me,
‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to go for alms.
This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation.’
So I sat down right there, thinking,
‘This is good enough for meditation.’
And so, being myself liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, I sought the unborn supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and I found it. Being myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, I sought the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and I found it.
Knowledge and vision arose in me:
‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.
But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it.
It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.
It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’
And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me:
‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this,
enough with trying to explain it!
This teaching is not easily understood
by those mired in greed and hate.
Those caught up in greed can’t see
what’s subtle, going against the stream,
deep, hard to see, and very fine,
for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’
So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, thought,
‘Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.
There will be those who understand the teaching!’
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he went on to say:
‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past
an impure teaching thought up by those still stained.
Fling open the door to the deathless!
Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered.
Standing high on a rocky mountain,
you can see the people all around.
In just the same way, all-seer, wise one,
having ascended the Temple of Truth,
rid of sorrow, look upon the people
swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age.
Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,
wander the world without obligation.
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!
There will be those who understand!’
Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings.
And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.
In the same way, I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes.
Then I replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati:
‘Flung open are the doors to the deathless!
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith.
Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach
the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.’
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there.
Then I thought,
‘Who should I teach first of all?
Who will quickly understand this teaching?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.
Why don’t I teach him first of all?
He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’
But a deity came to me and said,
‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’
And knowledge and vision arose in me,
‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’
I thought,
‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma.
If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’
Then I thought,
‘Who should I teach first of all?
Who will quickly understand this teaching?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘That Uddaka, son of Rāma, is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes.
Why don’t I teach him first of all?
He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’
But a deity came to me and said,
‘Sir, Uddaka, son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’
And knowledge and vision arose in me,
‘Uddaka, son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’
I thought,
‘This is a great loss for Uddaka.
If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’
Then I thought,
‘Who should I teach first of all?
Who will quickly understand this teaching?’
Then it occurred to me,
‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving.
Why don’t I teach them first of all?’
Then I thought,
‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I wished, I set out for Benares.
While I was traveling along the road between Gaya and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me
‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.
In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?’
I replied to Upaka in verse:
‘I am the champion, the knower of all,
unsullied in the midst of all things.
I’ve given up all, freed through the ending of craving.
Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?
I have no teacher.
There is no-one like me.
In the world with its gods,
I have no counterpart.
For in this world, I am the perfected one;
I am the supreme Teacher.
I alone am fully awakened,
cooled, extinguished.
I am going to the city of Kāsi
to roll forth the Wheel of Dhamma.
In this world that is so blind,
I’ll beat the deathless drum!’
‘According to what you claim, reverend, you ought to be the Infinite Victor.’
‘The victors are those who, like me,
have reached the ending of defilements.
I have conquered bad qualities, Upaka—
that’s why I’m a victor.’
When I had spoken, Upaka said: ‘If you say so, reverend.’ Shaking his head, he took a wrong turn and left.
Traveling stage by stage, I arrived at Benares, and went to see the group of five mendicants in the deer park at Isipatana.
The group of five mendicants saw me coming off in the distance
and stopped each other, saying,
‘Here comes the ascetic Gotama. He’s so indulgent; he strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.
We shouldn’t bow to him or rise for him or receive his bowl and robe.
But we can set out a seat; he can sit if he likes.’
Yet as I drew closer, the group of five mendicants were unable to stop themselves as they had agreed.
Some came out to greet me and receive my bowl and robe, some spread out a seat, while others set out water for washing my feet.
But they still addressed me by name and as ‘reverend’.
So I said to them,
‘Mendicants, don’t address me by name and as ‘reverend’.
The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved the Deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
But they said to me,
‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence?’
So I said to them,
‘The Realized One has not become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence.
The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved the Deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life.’
But for a second time they said to me,
‘Reverend Gotama … you’ve returned to indulgence.’
So for a second time I said to them,
‘The Realized One has not become indulgent …’
But for a third time they said to me,
‘Reverend Gotama, even by that conduct, that practice, that grueling work you did not achieve any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. How could you have achieved such a state now that you’ve become indulgent, strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence?’
So I said to them,
‘Mendicants, have you ever known me to speak like this before?’
‘No sir, we have not.’
‘The Realized One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha.
Listen up, mendicants: I have achieved the Deathless! I shall instruct you, I will teach you the Dhamma.
By practicing as instructed you will soon realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
I was able to persuade the group of five mendicants.
Then sometimes I advised two mendicants, while the other three went for alms.
Then those three would feed all six of us with what they brought back.
Sometimes I advised three mendicants, while the other two went for alms.
Then those two would feed all six of us with what they brought back.
As the group of five mendicants were being advised and instructed by me like this, being themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, they sought the unborn supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and they found it. Being themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they sought the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and they found it.
Knowledge and vision arose in them:
‘Our freedom is unshakable; this is our last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’
Mendicants, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they
have met with calamity and disaster, and are vulnerable to the Wicked One.
Suppose a deer in the wilderness was lying caught on a pile of snares.
You’d know that it
has met with calamity and disaster, and is vulnerable to the hunter.
And when the hunter comes, it cannot flee where it wants.
In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. You should understand that they
have met with calamity and disaster, and are vulnerable to the Wicked One.
There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation without being tied, infatuated, or attached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. You should understand that they
haven’t met with calamity and disaster, and are not vulnerable to the Wicked One.
Suppose a deer in the wilderness was lying on a pile of snares without being caught.
You’d know that it
hasn’t met with calamity and disaster, and isn’t vulnerable to the hunter.
And when the hunter comes, it can flee where it wants.
In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation without being tied, infatuated, or attached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. You should understand that they
haven’t met with calamity and disaster, and are not vulnerable to the Wicked One.
Suppose there was a wild deer wandering in the forest that walked, stood, sat, and laid down in confidence.
Why is that?
Because it’s out of the hunter’s range.
In the same way, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra …
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end.
This is called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see.
They’ve crossed over clinging to the world. And they walk, stand, sit, and lie down in confidence.
Why is that?
Because they’re out of the Wicked One’s range.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse on the Full-Moon Night
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.
Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”
“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.”
That mendicant took his seat and said to the Buddha:
“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates:
form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”
“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha.
Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question:
“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?”
“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.”
“But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”
Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.”
“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?”
“There can,” said the Buddha.
“It’s when someone thinks:
‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’
That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”
“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”
“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form.
Any kind of feeling at all …
Any kind of perception at all …
Any kind of choices at all …
Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness.
That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.”
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found?
What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling …
perception …
consciousness is found?”
“The four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found.
Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling …
perception …
and choices are found.
Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.”
“But sir, how does identity view come about?”
“It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.
They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.
They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.
They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
That’s how identity view comes about.”
“But sir, how does identity view not come about?”
“It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.
They don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.
They don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.
They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
That’s how identity view does not come about.”
“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form,
perception,
and consciousness?”
“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification.
That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.
Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling …
perception …
consciousness: this is its gratification.
That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.
Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.”
“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”
“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
One truly sees any kind of feeling …
perception …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
That’s how to know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.”
Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought,
“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.
Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?”
But the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:
“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think:
‘So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.
Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’
Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regard to all these things in all such cases.
What do you think, mendicants?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“What do you think, mendicants?
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near:
*all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
You should truly see any kind of feeling …
perception …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, *all* consciousness—with right understanding:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away.
When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping.
Middle Discourses
The Great Forty
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I will teach you noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what is noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites?
They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness.
Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites
is called noble right immersion with its vital conditions and also with its prerequisites.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
When you understand wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view, that’s your right view.
And what is wrong view?
‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There are no duties to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
This is wrong view.
And what is right view?
Right view is twofold, I say.
There is right view that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment.
And there is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.
And what is right view that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment?
‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are duties to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
This is right view that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment.
And what is right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?
It’s the wisdom—the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the awakening factor of investigation of principles, and right view as a factor of the path—in one of noble mind and undefiled mind, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.
This is called right view that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.
They make an effort to give up wrong view and embrace right view: that’s their right effort.
Mindfully they give up wrong view and take up right view: that’s their right mindfulness.
So these three things keep running and circling around right view, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
When you understand wrong thought as wrong thought and right thought as right thought, that’s your right view.
And what is wrong thought?
Thoughts of sensuality, of malice, and of cruelty.
This is wrong thought.
And what is right thought?
Right thought is twofold, I say.
There is right thought that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment.
And there is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.
And what is right thought that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment?
Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness.
This is right thought that is accompanied by defilements.
And what is right thought that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?
It’s the thinking—the placing of the mind, thought, applying, application, implanting of the mind, verbal processes—in one of noble mind and undefiled mind, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.
This is right thought that is noble.
They make an effort to give up wrong thought and embrace right thought: that’s their right effort.
Mindfully they give up wrong thought and take up right thought: that’s their right mindfulness.
So these three things keep running and circling around right thought, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
When you understand wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech, that’s your right view.
And what is wrong speech?
Speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical.
This is wrong speech.
And what is right speech?
Right speech is twofold, I say.
There is right speech that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment.
And there is right speech that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.
And what is right speech that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment?
The refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and talking nonsense.
This is right speech that is accompanied by defilements.
And what is right speech that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?
It’s the desisting, abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from the four kinds of bad verbal conduct in one of noble mind and undefiled mind, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.
This is right speech that is noble.
They make an effort to give up wrong speech and embrace right speech: that’s their right effort.
Mindfully they give up wrong speech and take up right speech: that’s their right mindfulness.
So these three things keep running and circling around right speech, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
When you understand wrong action as wrong action and right action as right action, that’s your right view.
And what is wrong action?
Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
This is wrong action.
And what is right action?
Right action is twofold, I say.
There is right action that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment.
And there is right action that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.
And what is right action that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment?
Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
This is right action that is accompanied by defilements.
And what is right action that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?
It’s the desisting, abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from the three kinds of bad bodily conduct in one of noble mind and undefiled mind, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.
This is right action that is noble.
They make an effort to give up wrong action and embrace right action: that’s their right effort.
Mindfully they give up wrong action and take up right action: that’s their right mindfulness.
So these three things keep running and circling around right action, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
When you understand wrong livelihood as wrong livelihood and right livelihood as right livelihood, that’s your right view.
And what is wrong livelihood?
Deceit, flattery, hinting, and belittling, and using material possessions to chase after other material possessions.
This is wrong livelihood.
And what is right livelihood?
Right livelihood is twofold, I say.
There is right livelihood that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment.
And there is right livelihood that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path.
And what is right livelihood that is accompanied by defilements, has the attributes of good deeds, and ripens in attachment?
It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood.
This is right livelihood that is accompanied by defilements.
And what is right livelihood that is noble, undefiled, transcendent, a factor of the path?
It’s the desisting, abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from wrong livelihood in one of noble mind and undefiled mind, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path.
This is right livelihood that is noble.
They make an effort to give up wrong livelihood and embrace right livelihood: that’s their right effort.
Mindfully they give up wrong livelihood and take up right livelihood: that’s their right mindfulness.
So these three things keep running and circling around right livelihood, namely: right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives rise to right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right action gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to right effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion. Right immersion gives rise to right knowledge. Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom.
So the trainee has eight factors, while the perfected one has ten factors.
And here too, the eradication of many bad, unskillful qualities is fully developed due to right knowledge.
In this context, right view comes first.
And how does right view come first?
For one of right view, wrong view is worn away.
And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong view are worn away.
And because of right view, many skillful qualities are fully developed.
For one of right thought, wrong thought is worn away. …
For one of right speech, wrong speech is worn away. …
For one of right action, wrong action is worn away. …
For one of right livelihood, wrong livelihood is worn away. …
For one of right effort, wrong effort is worn away. …
For one of right mindfulness, wrong mindfulness is worn away. …
For one of right immersion, wrong immersion is worn away. …
For one of right knowledge, wrong knowledge is worn away. …
For one of right freedom, wrong freedom is worn away.
And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong freedom are worn away.
And because of right freedom, many skillful qualities are fully developed.
So there are twenty on the side of the skillful, and twenty on the side of the unskillful.
This exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty has been rolled forth. And it cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
If any ascetic or brahmin imagines they can criticize and reject the exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty, they deserve rebuke and criticism on ten legitimate grounds in the present life.
If such a gentleman criticizes right view, they praise and honor the ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view.
If they criticize right thought …
right speech …
right action …
right livelihood …
right effort …
right mindfulness …
right immersion …
right knowledge …
right freedom, they praise and honor the ascetics and brahmins who have wrong freedom.
If any ascetic or brahmin imagines they can criticize and reject the exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty, they deserve rebuke and criticism on these ten legitimate grounds in the present life.
Even those wanderers of the past, Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā, who taught the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that the Great Forty should be criticized or rejected.
Why is that?
For fear of blame, attack, and condemnation.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Advice to Channa
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta, Mahācunda, and Channa were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him,
“Come, Reverend Cunda, let’s go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda.
And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.
Then Sāriputta said to Channa,
“I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.
The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.
I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
Reverend Sāriputta, I will slit my wrists. I don’t wish to live.”
“Please don’t slit your wrists!
Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.
If you don’t have any suitable food, we’ll find it for you.
If you don’t have suitable medicine, we’ll find it for you.
If you don’t have a capable carer, we’ll find one for you.
Please don’t slit your wrists!
Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.”
“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s not that I don’t have suitable food,
or suitable medicine,
or a capable carer.
Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love.
For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love.
You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’”
“I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”
“Ask, Reverend Sāriputta. When I’ve heard it I’ll know.”
“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?
Do you regard the ear …
mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, I regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
I regard the ear …
mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”
“Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”
When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa:
“So, Reverend Channa, you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can:
‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation.
When there’s no agitation there is tranquility.
When there is tranquility there’s no inclination.
When there’s no inclination there’s no coming and going.
When there’s no coming and going there’s no passing away and reappearing.
When there’s no passing away and reappearing there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two.
Just this is the end of suffering.’”
And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left.
Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists.
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Venerable Channa has slit his wrists.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?”
“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?”
“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana
where Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.”
“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families.
But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’.
When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’.
But the mendicant Channa did no such thing.
You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Sāriputta was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse at Gosiṅga
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
Now at that time the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to that park.
The park keeper saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and said to him,
“Don’t come into this park, ascetic.
There are three gentlemen who love themselves staying here.
Don’t disturb them.”
Anuruddha heard the park keeper conversing with the Buddha,
and said to him,
“Don’t keep the Buddha out, good park keeper!
Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived.”
Then Anuruddha went to Nandiya and Kimbila, and said to them,
“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has arrived!”
Then Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila came out to greet the Buddha.
One received his bowl and robe, one spread out a seat, and one set out water for washing his feet.
He sat on the seat spread out
and washed his feet.
Those venerables bowed and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to Anuruddha,
“I hope you’re keeping well, Anuruddha and friends; I hope you’re alright. And I hope you’re having no trouble getting alms-food.”
“Weʼre alright, Blessed One, weʼre getting by. And we have no trouble getting alms-food.”
“I hope you’re living in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes?”
“Indeed, sir, we live in harmony like this.”
“But how do you live this way?”
“In this case, sir, I think,
‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate,
to live together with spiritual companions such as these.’
I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private.
‘Why don’t I set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables’ ideas?’
And that’s what I do.
Though we’re different in body, sir, we’re one in mind, it seems to me.”
And the venerables Nandiya and Kimbila spoke likewise, and they added:
“That’s how we live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
But I hope you’re living diligently, keen, and resolute?”
“Indeed, sir, we live diligently.”
“But how do you live this way?”
“In this case, sir, whoever returns first from alms-round prepares the seats, and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin.
If there’s anything left over, whoever returns last eats it if they like. Otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.
Then they put away the seats, drinking water, and rubbish bin, and sweep the refectory.
If someone sees that the pot of water for washing, drinking, or the toilet is empty they set it up.
If he can’t do it, he summons another with a wave of the hand, and they set it up by lifting it with their hands. But we don’t break into speech for that reason.
And every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings.
That’s how we live diligently, keen, and resolute.”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, we enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease, that we have achieved while living diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Good, good!
But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, we enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”
“Good, good!
But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, with the fading away of rapture, we enter and remain in the third absorption, where we meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”
“Good, good!
But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, we enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”
“Good, good!
But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, we enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.
This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”
“Good, good!
But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, we enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …
going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, we enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …
going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, we enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is another superhuman distinction that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.”
“Good, good!
But have you achieved any other superhuman distinction for going beyond and stilling that meditation?”
“How could we not, sir?
Whenever we want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, we enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, our defilements have come to an end.
This is another superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease, that we have achieved for going beyond and stilling that meditation.
And we don’t see any better or finer way of meditating at ease than this.”
“Good, good!
There is no better or finer way of meditating at ease than this.”
Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.
The venerables then accompanied the Buddha for a little way before turning back. Nandiya and Kimbila said to Anuruddha,
“Did we ever tell you that we had
gained such and such meditations and attainments, up to the ending of defilements, as you revealed to the Buddha?”
“The venerables did not tell me that they had
gained such meditations and attainments. But I discovered it by comprehending your minds,
and deities also told me.
I answered when the Buddha directly asked about it.”
Then the native spirit Dīgha Parajana went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
“The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky
that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen,
the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”
Hearing the cry of Dīgha Parajana, the Earth Gods raised the cry …
Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings …
the Gods of the Thirty-Three …
the Gods of Yama …
the Joyful Gods …
the Gods Who Love to Create …
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others …
the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry,
“The Vajjis are lucky! The Vajjian people are so very lucky
that the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha stays there, as well as these three gentlemen,
the venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila.”
And so at that moment, in that instant, those venerables were known as far as the Brahmā realm.
“That’s so true, Dīgha! That’s so true!
If the family from which those three gentlemen went forth from the lay life to homelessness were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for that family’s lasting welfare and happiness.
If the family circle …
all the aristocrats …
all the brahmins …
all the merchants …
all the workers were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for all those workers’ lasting welfare and happiness.
If the whole world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to recollect those venerables with confident heart, that would be for the whole world’s lasting welfare and happiness.
See, Dīgha, how those three gentlemen are practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the native spirit Dīgha Parajana was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Guaranteed
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā.
The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha.
Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
The Buddha said to them:
“So, householders, is there some other teacher you’re happy with, in whom you have acquired grounded faith?”
“No, sir.”
“Since you haven’t found a teacher you’re happy with, you should undertake and implement this guaranteed teaching.
For when the guaranteed teaching is undertaken, it will be for your lasting welfare and happiness.
And what is the guaranteed teaching?
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this.
‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There is obligation to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’
What do you think, householders?
Don’t these doctrines directly contradict each other?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
there’s no meaning in giving, etc.
You can expect that they will reject good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and undertake and implement bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
Why is that?
Because those ascetics and brahmins don’t see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks, sordidness, and corruption, or that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.
Moreover, since there actually is another world, their view that there is no other world is wrong view.
Since there actually is another world, their thought that there is no other world is wrong thought.
Since there actually is another world, their speech that there is no other world is wrong speech.
Since there actually is another world, in saying that there is no other world they contradict those perfected ones who know the other world.
Since there actually is another world, in convincing another that there is no other world they are convincing them to accept an untrue teaching.
And on account of that they glorify themselves and put others down.
So they give up their former ethical conduct and are established in unethical conduct.
And that is how wrong view gives rise to these many bad, unskillful qualities—wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept untrue teachings, and glorifying oneself and putting others down.
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘If there is no other world, when this individual’s body breaks up they will keep themselves safe.
And if there is another world, when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
But let’s assume that those who say that there is no other world are correct.
Regardless, that individual is still criticized by sensible people in the present life as being an immoral individual of wrong view, a nihilist.’
But if there really is another world, they lose on both counts.
For they are criticized by sensible people in the present life, and when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
They have wrongly undertaken this guaranteed teaching in such a way that it encompasses the positive outcomes of one side only, leaving out the skillful premise.
Since this is so, consider those ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
there is meaning in giving, etc.
You can expect that they will reject bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and undertake and implement good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind.
Why is that?
Because those ascetics and brahmins see that unskillful qualities are full of drawbacks, sordidness, and corruption, and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.
Moreover, since there actually is another world, their view that there is another world is right view.
Since there actually is another world, their thought that there is another world is right thought.
Since there actually is another world, their speech that there is another world is right speech.
Since there actually is another world, in saying that there is another world they don’t contradict those perfected ones who know the other world.
Since there actually is another world, in convincing another that there is another world they are convincing them to accept a true teaching.
And on account of that they don’t glorify themselves or put others down.
So they give up their former unethical conduct and are established in ethical conduct.
And that is how right view gives rise to these many skillful qualities—right view, right thought, right speech, not contradicting the noble ones, convincing others to accept true teachings, and not glorifying oneself or putting others down.
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘If there is another world, when this individual’s body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
But let’s assume that those who say that there is no other world are correct.
Regardless, that individual is still praised by sensible people in the present life as being a moral individual of right view, who affirms a positive teaching.’
So if there really is another world, they win on both counts.
For they are praised by sensible people in the present life, and when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
They have rightly undertaken this guaranteed teaching in such a way that it encompasses the positive outcomes of both sides, leaving out the unskillful premise.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘The one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie.
If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.
If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.
If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit.
In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’
And there are some ascetics and brahmins whose doctrine directly contradicts this. They say:
‘The one who acts does a bad deed when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do a bad deed when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie.

“Yes, sir.”

Moreover, since action actually does have an effect, their view that action is ineffective is wrong view.
Since action actually does have an effect, their thought that action is ineffective is wrong thought.

There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘There is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings.
Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason.
There’s no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings.
Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.
There is no power, no energy, no human strength or vigor.
All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.’

Some ascetics and brahmins say that
there are totally formless meditations, but I have not known that.
Without knowing or seeing, it would not be appropriate for me to take one side and declare,
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’
If those ascetics and brahmins who say that
there are no totally formless meditations are correct, it is possible
that I will be guaranteed rebirth among the gods who possess form and made of mind.
If those ascetics and brahmins who say that
there are totally formless meditations are correct, it is possible
that I will be guaranteed rebirth among the gods who are formless and made of perception.
Now, owing to form, bad things are seen: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and fights, accusations, divisive speech, and lies.
But those things don’t exist where it is totally formless.’
Reflecting like this, they simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding forms.

Householders, these four people are found in the world.
What four?
One person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.
One person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others.
One person mortifies themselves and others, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
One person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.
They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.
And what person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves?
It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. …
And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body.
This is called a person who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves.
And what person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others?
It’s when a person is a butcher of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood.
This is called a person who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others.
And what person mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others?
It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin. …
His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces.
This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others.
And what person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others,
living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves?
It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …
They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption …
second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives. …
They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others.
They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves.”
When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Sālā said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
Prepared Chariots
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then several mendicants who had completed the rainy season residence in their native land went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to them:
“In your native land, mendicants, which of the native mendicants is esteemed in this way:
‘Personally having few wishes, they speak to the mendicants on having few wishes. Personally having contentment, seclusion, aloofness, energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom, they speak to the mendicants on all these things. They’re an adviser and instructor, one who educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires their spiritual companions.’”
“Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, sir, is esteemed in this way in our native land.”
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the Buddha.
Then he thought:
“Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta is fortunate, so very fortunate,
in that his sensible spiritual companions praise him point by point in the presence of the Teacher, and that the Teacher seconds that appreciation.
Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa, and we can have a discussion.”
When the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he wished, he set out for Sāvatthī.
Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,
where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Puṇṇa heard that the Buddha had arrived at Sāvatthī.
Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.
Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Grove. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.
Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Puṇṇa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.
Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and said to him,
“Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant named Puṇṇa, of whom you have often spoken so highly, after being inspired by a talk of the Buddha’s, left for the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”
Sāriputta quickly grabbed his sitting cloth and followed behind Puṇṇa, keeping sight of his head.
Puṇṇa plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.
And Sāriputta did likewise.
Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Puṇṇa, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Puṇṇa:
“Reverend, is our spiritual life lived under the Buddha?”
“Yes, reverend.”
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of ethics?”
“Certainly not.”
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of mind?”
“Certainly not.”
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of view?”
“Certainly not.”
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification through overcoming doubt?”
“Certainly not.”
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of paths?”
“Certainly not.”
“Then is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice?”
“Certainly not.”
“Is the spiritual life lived under the Buddha for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision?”
“Certainly not.”
“When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’
Then what exactly is the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha?”
“The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is extinguishment by not grasping.”
“Reverend, is purification of ethics extinguishment by not grasping?”
“Certainly not.”
“Is purification of knowledge and vision extinguishment by not grasping?”
“Certainly not.”
“Then is extinguishment by not grasping something apart from these things?”
“Certainly not.”
“When asked each of these questions, you answered, ‘Certainly not.’
How then should we see the meaning of this statement?”
“If the Buddha had declared purification of ethics to be extinguishment by not grasping, he would have declared that which has grasping to be extinguishment by not grasping. …
If the Buddha had declared purification of knowledge and vision to be extinguishment by not grasping, he would have declared that which has grasping to be extinguishment by not grasping.
But if extinguishment by not grasping was something apart from these things, an ordinary person would become extinguished.
For an ordinary person lacks these things.
Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile.
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.
Suppose that, while staying in Sāvatthī, King Pasenadi of Kosala had some urgent business come up in Sāketa.
Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven prepared chariots were stationed ready for him.
Then Pasenadi, having departed Sāvatthī, mounted the first prepared chariot by the gate of the royal compound. The first prepared chariot would bring him to the second, where he’d dismount and mount the second chariot.
The second prepared chariot would bring him to the third …
The third prepared chariot would bring him to the fourth …
The fourth prepared chariot would bring him to the fifth …
The fifth prepared chariot would bring him to the sixth …
The sixth prepared chariot would bring him to the seventh, where he’d dismount and mount the seventh chariot.
The seventh prepared chariot would bring him to the gate of the royal compound of Sāketa.
And when he was at the gate, friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would ask him:
‘Great king, did you come to Sāketa from Sāvatthī by this prepared chariot?’
If asked this, how should King Pasenadi rightly reply?”
“The king should reply:
‘Well, while staying in Sāvatthī, I had some urgent business come up in Sāketa.
Now, between Sāvatthī and Sāketa seven prepared chariots were stationed ready for me.
Then, having departed Sāvatthī, I mounted the first prepared chariot by the gate of the royal compound.
The first prepared chariot brought me to the second, where I dismounted and mounted the second chariot. …
The sixth prepared chariot brought me to the seventh, where I dismounted and mounted the seventh chariot.
The seventh prepared chariot brought me to the gate of the royal compound of Sāketa.’
That’s how King Pasenadi should rightly reply.”
“In the same way, reverend, purification of ethics is only for the sake of purification of mind. Purification of mind is only for the sake of purification of view. Purification of view is only for the sake of purification through overcoming doubt. Purification through overcoming doubt is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of paths. Purification of knowledge and vision of the variety of paths is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision of the practice. Purification of knowledge and vision of the practice is only for the sake of purification of knowledge and vision. Purification of knowledge and vision is only for the sake of extinguishment by not grasping.
The spiritual life is lived under the Buddha for the sake of extinguishment by not grasping.”
When he said this, Sāriputta said to Puṇṇa,
“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your spiritual companions?”
“Reverend, my name is Puṇṇa.
And I am known as Mantāṇiputta among my spiritual companions.”
“It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing!
Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta has answered each deep question point by point, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions.
It is fortunate for his spiritual companions, so very fortunate,
that they get to see Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta and pay homage to him.
Even if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them! And it’s fortunate for me, so very fortunate, that I get to see the venerable and pay homage to him.”
When he said this, Puṇṇa said to Sāriputta,
“What is the venerable’s name? And how are you known among your spiritual companions?”
“Reverend, my name is Upatissa.
And I am known as Sāriputta among my spiritual companions.”
“Goodness! I had no idea I was consulting with *the* Venerable Sāriputta, the disciple who is fit to be compared with the Teacher himself!
If I’d known, I wouldn’t have said so much.
It’s incredible, reverend, it’s amazing!
Venerable Sāriputta has asked each deep question point by point, as a learned disciple who rightly understands the teacher’s instructions.
It is fortunate for his spiritual companions, so very fortunate,
that they get to see Venerable Sāriputta and pay homage to him.
Even if they only got to see him and pay respects to him by carrying him around on their heads on a roll of cloth, it would still be very fortunate for them! And it’s fortunate for me, so very fortunate, that I get to see the venerable and pay homage to him.”
And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this:
‘Greed, hate, and delusion are corruptions of the mind.’
Despite understanding this, sometimes my mind is occupied by thoughts of greed, hate, and delusion.
I wonder what qualities remain in me that I have such thoughts?”
“Mahānāma, there is a quality that remains in you that makes you have such thoughts.
For if you had given up that quality you would not still be living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.
But because you haven’t given up that quality you are still living at home and enjoying sensual pleasures.
Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.
Even though a noble disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom, so long as they don’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,
they might still return to sensual pleasures.
But when they do achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,
they will not return to sensual pleasures.
Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right wisdom that:
‘Sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks.’
But so long as I didn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that,
I didn’t announce that I would not return to sensual pleasures.
But when I did achieve that rapture and bliss, or something more peaceful than that,
I announced that I would not return to sensual pleasures.
And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures?
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation: this is the gratification of sensual pleasures.
And what is the drawback of sensual pleasures?
It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as
computing, accounting, calculating, farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.
But they must face cold and heat, being hurt by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles, and risking death from hunger and thirst.
This is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, but fail to earn any money.
If this happens, they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion, saying: ‘Oh, my hard work is wasted. My efforts are fruitless!’
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
That gentleman might try hard, strive, and make an effort, and succeed in earning money.
But they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it, thinking:
‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’
And even though they protect it and ward it, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it.
They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion:
‘What used to be mine is gone.’
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures kings fight with kings, aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders. A mother fights with her child, child with mother, father with child, and child with father. Brother fights with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and friend fights with friend.
Once they’ve started quarreling, arguing, and fighting, they attack each other with fists, stones, rods, and swords,
resulting in death and deadly pain.
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and plunge into a battle massed on both sides, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing.
There they are struck with arrows and spears, and their heads are chopped off,
resulting in death and deadly pain.
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield, fasten their bow and arrows, and charge wetly plastered bastions, with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing.
There they are struck with arrows and spears, splashed with dung, crushed with spiked blocks, and their heads are chopped off,
resulting in death and deadly pain.
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures they break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, and commit adultery.
The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments—
whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded.
These result in death and deadly pain.
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
Furthermore, for the sake of sensual pleasures, they conduct themselves badly by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
This is a drawback of sensual pleasures to do with lives to come, a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures.
Mahānāma, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time several Jain ascetics on the slopes of Isigili at the Black Rock were constantly standing, refusing seats. And they felt painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion.
Then in the late afternoon, I came out of retreat and went to the Black Rock to visit those Jain ascetics. I said to them,
‘Reverends, why are you constantly standing, refusing seats, so that you suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion?’
When I said this, those Jain ascetics said to me,
‘Reverend, the Jain leader Nātaputta claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
“Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.”
“O Jain ascetics, you have done bad deeds in a past life. Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities.
And when you refrain from such deeds in the present by way of body, speech, and mind, you’re not doing any bad deeds for the future.
So, due to eliminating past deeds by mortification, and not doing any new deeds, there’s nothing to come up in the future.
With nothing to come up in the future, deeds end. With the ending of deeds, suffering ends. With the ending of suffering, feeling ends. And with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away.”
We like and accept this, and we are satisfied with it.’
When they said this, I said to them,
‘But reverends, do you know
for sure that you existed in the past, and it is not the case that you didn’t exist?’
‘No we don’t, reverend.’
‘But reverends, do you know
for sure that you did bad deeds in the past?’
‘No we don’t, reverend.’
‘But reverends, do you know
that you did such and such bad deeds?’
‘No we don’t, reverend.’
‘But reverends, do you know
that so much suffering has already been worn away? Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away? Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn away?’
‘No we don’t, reverend.’
‘But reverends, do you know
about giving up unskillful qualities in the present life and embracing skillful qualities?’
‘No we don’t, reverend.’
‘So it seems that you don’t know any of these things.
That being so, when those in the world who are violent and bloody-handed and make their living by cruelty are reborn among humans they go forth as Jain ascetics.’
‘Reverend Gotama, pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.
For if pleasure were to be gained through pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Māgadha would gain pleasure, since he lives in greater pleasure than Venerable Gotama.’
‘Clearly the venerables have spoken rashly, without reflection.
Rather, I’m the one who should be asked about
who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or Venerable Gotama?’
‘Clearly we spoke rashly and without reflection.
But forget about that. Now we ask Venerable Gotama:
“Who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or Venerable Gotama?”'
‘Well then, reverends, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, reverends?
Is King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing perfect happiness for seven days and nights without moving his body or speaking?’
‘No he is not, reverend.’
‘What do you think, reverends?
Is King Bimbisāra capable of experiencing perfect happiness for six days …
five days …
four days …
three days …
two days …
‘No he is not, reverend.’
‘But I am capable of experiencing perfect happiness for one day and night without moving my body or speaking.
I am capable of experiencing perfect happiness for two days …
three days …
four days …
five days …
six days …
seven days.
What do you think, reverends? This being so, who lives in greater pleasure, King Bimbisāra or I?’
‘This being so, Venerable Gotama lives in greater pleasure than King Bimbisāra.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Mahānāma the Sakyan was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.
Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.
May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.
That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha,
bowed, stood to one side,
and told him of their preparations, saying,
“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”
Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.
The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.
The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.
The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he addressed Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, speak about the practicing trainee to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu as you feel inspired.
My back is sore,
I’ll stretch it.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
Then Ānanda addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan:
“Mahānāma, a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. They have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
And how is a noble disciple accomplished in ethics?
It’s when a noble disciple is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
That’s how a noble disciple is ethical.
And how does a noble disciple guard the sense doors?
When a noble disciple sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.
That’s how a noble disciple guards the sense doors.
And how does a noble disciple eat in moderation?
It’s when a noble disciple reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice.
In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
That’s how a noble disciple eats in moderation.
And how is a noble disciple dedicated to wakefulness?
It’s when a noble disciple practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.
In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.
In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.
That’s how a noble disciple is dedicated to wakefulness.
And how does a noble disciple have seven good qualities?
It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
They have a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.
They exercise prudence. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities.
They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.
These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
They’re mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago.
They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
That’s how a noble disciple has seven good qualities.
And how does a noble disciple get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty?
It’s when a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …
second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
That’s how a noble disciple gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
When a noble disciple is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness; and they have seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme sanctuary.
Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that chicken doesn’t wish,
‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’
Still they can break out and hatch safely.
In the same way, when a noble disciple is practicing all these things they are called a noble disciple who is a practicing trainee. Their eggs are unspoiled, and they are capable of breaking out of their shell, becoming awakened, and achieving the supreme sanctuary.
Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives.
That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
This is their first breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.
Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
This is their second breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.
Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity, that noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
This is their third breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell.
A noble disciple’s conduct includes the following: being accomplished in ethics,
guarding the sense doors,
moderation in eating,
being dedicated to wakefulness,
having seven good qualities,
and getting the four absorptions when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
A noble disciple’s knowledge includes the following: recollecting their past lives,
clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman,
and realizing the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life due to the ending of defilements.
This noble disciple is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’.
And Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse:
‘The aristocrat is first among people
who take clan as the standard.
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct
is first among gods and humans.’
And that verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by the Buddha.”
Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Good, good, Ānanda!
It’s good that you spoke to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the practicing trainee.”
This is what Venerable Ānanda said,
and the teacher approved.
Satisfied, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu were happy with what Venerable Ānanda said.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Classification
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then the layman Visākha went to see the nun Dhammadinnā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:
“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘identity’.
What is this identity that the Buddha spoke of?”
“Visākha, the Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are identity.
That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
The Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are identity.”
Saying “Good, ma’am,” Visākha approved and agreed with what Dhammadinnā said. Then he asked another question:
“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘the origin of identity’.
What is the origin of identity that the Buddha spoke of?”
“It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is,
craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.
The Buddha said that this is the origin of identity.”
“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘the cessation of identity’.
What is the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of?”
“It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it.
The Buddha said that this is the cessation of identity.”
“Ma’am, they speak of the practice that leads to the cessation of identity.
What is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of?”
“The practice that leads to the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”
“But ma’am, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”
“That grasping is not the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates. Nor is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another.
The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”
“But ma’am, how does identity view come about?”
“It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They regard feeling …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
That’s how identity view comes about.”
“But ma’am, how does identity view not come about?”
“It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They don’t regard feeling …
perception …
consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
That’s how identity view does not come about.”
“But ma’am, what is the noble eightfold path?”
“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”
“But ma’am, is the noble eightfold path conditioned or unconditioned?”
“The noble eightfold path is conditioned.”
“Are the three practice categories included in the noble eightfold path? Or is the noble eightfold path included in the three practice categories?”
“The three practice categories are not included in the noble eightfold path. Rather, the noble eightfold path is included in the three practice categories.
Right speech, right action, and right livelihood: these things are included in the category of ethics.
Right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion: these things are included in the category of immersion.
Right view and right thought: these things are included in the category of wisdom.”
“But ma’am, what is immersion? What things are the foundations of immersion? What things are the prerequisites for immersion? What is the development of immersion?”
“Unification of the mind is immersion.
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the foundations of immersion.
The four right efforts are the prerequisites for immersion.
The cultivation, development, and making much of these very same things is the development of immersion.”
“How many processes are there?”
“There are these three processes.
Physical, verbal, and mental processes.”
“But ma’am, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?”
“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.”
“But ma’am, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?”
“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process.
First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes.
Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.”
“But ma’am, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?”
“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think:
‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’
Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”
“But ma’am, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”
“Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental.”
“But ma’am, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?”
“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think:
‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’
Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”
“But ma’am, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”
“Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal.”
“But ma’am, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?”
“They experience three kinds of contact: emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.”
“But ma’am, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?”
“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.”
“But ma’am, how many feelings are there?”
“There are three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.”
“What are these three feelings?”
“Anything felt physically or mentally as pleasant or enjoyable.
This is pleasant feeling.
Anything felt physically or mentally as painful or unpleasant.
This is painful feeling.
Anything felt physically or mentally as neither pleasurable nor painful.
This is neutral feeling.”
“What is pleasant and what is painful in each of the three feelings?”
“Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it perishes.
Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when it perishes.
Neutral feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge, and painful when there is ignorance.”
“What underlying tendencies underlie each of the three feelings?”
“The underlying tendency for greed underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency for repulsion underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neutral feeling.”
“Do these underlying tendencies always underlie these feelings?”
“No, they do not.”
“What should be given up in regard to each of these three feelings?”
“The underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feeling.”
“Should these underlying tendencies be given up regarding all instances of these feelings?”
“No, not in all instances.
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
With this they give up greed, and the underlying tendency to greed does not lie within that.
And take a mendicant who reflects:
‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’
Nursing such a longing for the supreme liberations gives rise to sadness due to longing.
With this they give up repulsion, and the underlying tendency to repulsion does not lie within that.
Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
With this they give up ignorance, and the underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie within that.”
“But ma’am, what is the counterpart of pleasant feeling?”
“Painful feeling.”
“What is the counterpart of painful feeling?”
“Pleasant feeling.”
“What is the counterpart of neutral feeling?”
“Ignorance.”
“What is the counterpart of ignorance?”
“Knowledge.”
“What is the counterpart of knowledge?”
“Freedom.”
“What is the counterpart of freedom?”
“Extinguishment.”
“What is the counterpart of extinguishment?”
“Your question goes too far, Visākha. You couldn’t figure out the limit of questions.
For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.
If you wish, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.”
And then the layman Visākha approved and agreed with what the nun Dhammadinnā said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right. Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.
When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,
“The nun Dhammadinnā is astute, Visākha, she has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as the nun Dhammadinnā.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the layman Visākha was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Great Discourse on Taking Up Practices
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, sentient beings typically have the wish, desire, and hope:
‘Oh, if only unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things would decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things would increase!’
But exactly the opposite happens to them.
What do you take to be the reason for this?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster.
So they cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they should.
When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things increase, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things decrease.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.
But an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster.
So they cultivate and foster practices they should, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t.
When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things increase.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it’s like for someone who knows.
Mendicants, there are these four ways of taking up practices.
What four?
There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.
There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.
There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure.
There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain, an ignoramus, without knowing this, doesn’t truly understand:
‘This is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.’
So instead of avoiding that practice, they cultivate it.
When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things increase, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things decrease.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pain, an ignoramus …
cultivates it …
and disagreeable things increase …
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pleasure, an ignoramus …
doesn’t cultivate it …
and disagreeable things increase …
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, an ignoramus …
doesn’t cultivate it …
and disagreeable things increase …
Why is that?
Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know.
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain, a wise person, knowing this, truly understands:
‘This is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.’
So instead of cultivating that practice, they avoid it.
When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things increase.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it’s like for someone who knows.
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pain, a wise person …
doesn’t cultivate it …
and agreeable things increase …
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pleasure, a wise person …
cultivates it …
and agreeable things increase …
When it comes to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, a wise person, knowing this, truly understands:
‘This is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.’
So instead of avoiding that practice, they cultivate it.
When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things increase.
Why is that?
Because that’s what it’s like for someone who knows.
And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain?
It’s when someone in pain and sadness kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. Because of these things they experience pain and sadness.
And when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
This is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain.
And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain?
It’s when someone with pleasure and happiness kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. Because of these things they experience pleasure and happiness.
But when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain.
And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure?
It’s when someone in pain and sadness doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, with right view. Because of these things they experience pain and sadness.
But when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
This is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure.
And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure?
It’s when someone with pleasure and happiness doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, with right view. Because of these things they experience pleasure and happiness.
And when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure.
These are the four ways of taking up practices.
Suppose there was some bitter gourd mixed with poison.
Then a man would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.
They’d say to him:
‘Here, mister, this is bitter gourd mixed with poison.
Drink it if you like.
If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be unappetizing, and it will result in death or deadly pain.’
He wouldn’t reject it. Without reflection, he’d drink it.
The color, aroma, and flavor would be unappetizing, and it would result in death or deadly pain.
This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain, I say.
Suppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor.
But it was mixed with poison.
Then a man would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.
They’d say to him:
‘Here, mister, this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color, aroma, and flavor.
But it’s mixed with poison.
Drink it if you like.
If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing, but it will result in death or deadly pain.’
He wouldn’t reject it. Without reflection, he’d drink it.
The color, aroma, and flavor would be appetizing, but it would result in death or deadly pain.
This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pain, I say.
Suppose there was some fermented urine mixed with different medicines.
Then a man with jaundice would come along.
They’d say to him:
‘Here, mister, this is fermented urine mixed with different medicines. Drink it if you like.
If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be unappetizing, but after drinking it you will be happy.’
He wouldn’t reject it. After appraisal, he’d drink it.
The color, aroma, and flavor would be unappetizing, but after drinking it he would be happy.
This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pleasure, I say.
Suppose there was some curds, honey, ghee, and molasses all mixed together.
Then a man with dysentery would come along.
They’d say to him:
‘Here, mister, this is curds, honey, ghee, and molasses all mixed together. Drink it if you like.
If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing, and after drinking it you will be happy.’
He wouldn’t reject it. After appraisal, he’d drink it.
The color, aroma, and flavor would be appetizing, and after drinking it he would be happy.
This is comparable to the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure, I say.
It’s like the time after the rainy season when the sky is clear and cloudless. And when the sun rises, it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates.
In the same way, this way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure dispels the doctrines of the various other ascetics and brahmins as it shines and glows and radiates.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Five and Three
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future, and assert various hypotheses concerning the future.
Some propose this: ‘The self is percipient and is sound after death.’
Some propose this: ‘The self is non-percipient and is sound after death.’
Some propose this: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and is sound after death.’
But some assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in the present life.
Thus they assert an existent self that is sound after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; or they propose extinguishment in the present life.
In this way five become three, and three become five.
This is the passage for recitation of the five and three.
Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness, limitless and imperturbable.
The Realized One understands this as follows.
There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death, describing it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception.
Or some, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, propose the dimension of nothingness, limitless and imperturbable. They declare that this is the purest, highest, best, and supreme of all those perceptions, whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversity.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding thus and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless.
So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death.
Why is that?
Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime.
The Realized One understands this as follows.
There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and sound after death, describing it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless.
But if any ascetic or brahmin should say this:
‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’
That is not possible.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and sound after death describe it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless.
So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and sound after death, as well as those who assert a self that is non-percipient and sound after death.
Why is that?
Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime.
The Realized One understands this as follows.
There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and sound after death, describing it as having form, or being formless, or both having form and being formless, or neither having form nor being formless.
Some ascetics or brahmins assert the embracing of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what is seen, heard, thought, and known. But that is said to be a disastrous approach.
For that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomena,
but only with a residue of conditioned phenomena.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being reject those who assert a self that is sound after death, whether percipient or non-percipient or neither percipient non-percipient.
Why is that?
Because all of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to moving up to a higher realm:
‘After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!’
Suppose a trader was going to market, thinking:
‘With this, that shall be mine! This way, I shall get that!’
In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins seem to be like traders when they say:
‘After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!’
The Realized One understands this as follows.
The ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being; from fear and disgust with identity, they just keep running and circling around identity.
Suppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar. It would just keeping running and circling around that post or pillar.
In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins, from fear and disgust with identity, just keep running and circling around identity.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Whatever ascetics and brahmins theorize about the future, and propose various hypotheses concerning the future, all of them propose one or other of these five theses.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past, and propose various hypotheses concerning the past. They propose the following, each insisting that theirs is the only truth and that everything else is wrong.
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal.’
‘The self and the cosmos are not eternal.’
‘The self and the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal.’
‘The self and the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal.’
‘The self and the cosmos are finite.’
‘The self and the cosmos are infinite.’
‘The self and the cosmos are both finite and infinite.’
‘The self and the cosmos are neither finite nor infinite.’
‘The self and the cosmos are unified in perception.’
‘The self and the cosmos are diverse in perception.’
‘The self and the cosmos have limited perception.’
‘The self and the cosmos have limitless perception.’
‘The self and the cosmos experience nothing but happiness.’
‘The self and the cosmos experience nothing but suffering.’
‘The self and the cosmos experience both happiness and suffering.’
‘The self and the cosmos experience neither happiness nor suffering.’
Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows.
‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ It’s simply not possible for them to have purified and clear personal knowledge of this, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration.
And in the absence of such knowledge, even the partial knowledge that they are clear about is said to be grasping on their part.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows.
The self and the cosmos are not eternal,
or both eternal and not eternal,
or neither eternal nor not-eternal,
or finite,
or infinite,
or both finite and infinite,
or neither finite nor infinite,
or of unified perception,
or of diverse perception,
or of limited perception,
or of limitless perception,
or experience nothing but happiness,
or experience nothing but suffering,
or experience both happiness and suffering,
or experience neither happiness nor suffering. It’s simply not possible for them to have purified and clear personal knowledge of this, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration.
And in the absence of such knowledge, even the partial knowledge that they are clear about is said to be grasping on their part.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, enter and remain in the rapture of seclusion:
‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in the rapture of seclusion.’
But that rapture of seclusion of theirs ceases.
When the rapture of seclusion ceases, sadness arises; and when sadness ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises.
It’s like how the sunlight fills the space when the shadow leaves, or the shadow fills the space when the sunshine leaves.
In the same way, when the rapture of seclusion ceases, sadness arises; and when sadness ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises.
The Realized One understands this as follows.
This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, enters and remains in the rapture of seclusion:
‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in the rapture of seclusion.’
But that rapture of seclusion of theirs ceases.
When the rapture of seclusion ceases, sadness arises; and when sadness ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion, enter and remain in spiritual bliss.
‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in spiritual bliss.’
But that spiritual bliss of theirs ceases.
When spiritual bliss ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises; and when the rapture of seclusion ceases, spiritual bliss arises.
It’s like how the sunlight fills the space when the shadow leaves, or the shadow fills the space when the sunshine leaves. …
The Realized One understands this as follows.
This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion, enters and remains in spiritual bliss.
‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in spiritual bliss.’
But that spiritual bliss of theirs ceases.
When spiritual bliss ceases, the rapture of seclusion arises; and when the rapture of seclusion ceases, spiritual bliss arises.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion and spiritual bliss, enter and remain in neutral feeling.
‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in neutral feeling.’
Then that neutral feeling ceases.
When neutral feeling ceases, spiritual bliss arises; and when spiritual bliss ceases, neutral feelings arises.
It’s like how the sunlight fills the space when the shadow leaves, or the shadow fills the space when the sunshine leaves. …
The Realized One understands this as follows.
This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, going beyond the rapture of seclusion and spiritual bliss, enters and remains in neutral feeling.
‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, entering and remaining in neutral feeling.’
Then that neutral feeling ceases.
When neutral feeling ceases, spiritual bliss arises; and when spiritual bliss ceases, neutral feelings arises.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
Now, some ascetics and brahmins, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, go beyond the rapture of seclusion, spiritual bliss, and neutral feeling.
They regard themselves like this: ‘I am at peace; I am extinguished; I am free of grasping.’
The Realized One understands this as follows.
This good ascetic or brahmin, letting go of theories about the past and the future, shedding the fetters of sensuality, goes beyond the rapture of seclusion, spiritual bliss, and neutral feeling.
They regard themselves like this: ‘I am at peace; I am extinguished; I am free of grasping.’
Clearly this venerable speaks of a practice that’s conducive to extinguishment.
Nevertheless, they still grasp at theories about the past or the future, or the fetters of sensuality, or the rapture of seclusion, or spiritual bliss, or neutral feeling.
And when they regard themselves like this:
‘I am at peace; I am extinguished; I am free of grasping,’ that’s also said to be grasping on their part.
‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—*that* is real.’
Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.
But the Realized One has awakened to the supreme state of sublime peace, that is,
liberation by not grasping after truly understanding these six sense fields’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Aṅgulimāla
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He was violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.
He laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.
He was constantly murdering people, and he wore their fingers as a necklace.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, he walked down the road that led to Aṅgulimāla.
The cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers saw him on the road,
and said to him,
“Don’t take this road, ascetic.
On this road there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.
He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.
He is constantly murdering people, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.
People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.
Still they meet their end by Aṅgulimāla’s hand.”
But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.
For a second time …
and a third time, they urged the Buddha to turn back.
But when they said this, the Buddha went on in silence.
The bandit Aṅgulimāla saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,
and thought,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
People travel along this road only after banding closely together in groups of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty.
Still they meet their end by my hand.
But still this ascetic comes along alone and unaccompanied, like he had beaten me already.
Why don’t I take his life?”
Then Aṅgulimāla donned his sword and shield, fastened his bow and arrows, and followed behind the Buddha.
But the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Aṅgulimāla could not catch up with him no matter how hard he tried, even though the Buddha kept walking at a normal speed.
Then Aṅgulimāla thought,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
Previously, even when I’ve chased a speeding elephant, horse, chariot or deer, I’ve always caught up with them.
But I can’t catch up with this ascetic no matter how hard I try, even though he’s walking at a normal speed.”
He stood still and said,
“Stop, stop, ascetic!”
“I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.”
Then Aṅgulimāla thought,
“These Sakyan ascetics speak the truth.
Yet while walking the ascetic Gotama says:
‘I’ve stopped, Aṅgulimāla—now you stop.’
Why don’t I ask him about this?”
Then he addressed the Buddha in verse:
“While walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’
And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not.
I’m asking you this, ascetic:
how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?”
“Aṅgulimāla, I have forever stopped—
I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures.
But you can’t stop yourself from harming living creatures;
that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.”
“Oh, at long last a hermit,
a great sage who I honor, has entered this great forest.
Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma,
I shall live without evil.”
With these words, the bandit hurled his sword and weapons
down a cliff into a chasm.
He venerated the Holy One’s feet,
and asked him for the going forth right away.
Then the Buddha, the compassionate great hermit,
the teacher of the world with its gods,
said to him, “Come, monk!”
And with that he became a monk.
Then the Buddha set out for Sāvatthī with Venerable Aṅgulimāla as his second monk.
Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,
where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time a crowd had gathered by the gate of King Pasenadi’s royal compound making a dreadful racket,
“In your realm, Your Majesty, there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.
He has laid waste to villages, towns, and countries.
He is constantly murdering people, and he wears their fingers as a necklace.
Your Majesty must put a stop to him!”
Then King Pasenadi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day with around five hundred horses,
heading for the monastery.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot.
He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“What is it, great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha angry with you, or the Licchavis of Vesālī, or some other opposing ruler?”
In my realm there is a bandit named Aṅgulimāla. He is violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. …
I shall put a stop to him.”
“But great king, suppose you were to see that Aṅgulimāla had shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. And that he was refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and lying; that he was eating in one part of the day, and was celibate, ethical, and of good character. What would you do to him?”
“I would bow to him, rise in his presence, or offer him a seat. I’d invite him to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize his lawful guarding and protection.
But sir, how could such an immoral, evil man ever have such virtue and restraint?”
Now at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla was sitting not far from the Buddha.
Then the Buddha pointed with his right arm and said to the king,
“Great king, this is Aṅgulimāla.”
Then the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end.
Knowing this, the Buddha said to him,
“Do not fear, great king. You have nothing to fear from him.”
Then the king’s fear died down.
Then the king went over to Aṅgulimāla and said,
“Sir, is the venerable really Aṅgulimāla?”
“Yes, great king.”
“What clans were your father and mother from?”
“My father was a Gagga, and my mother a Mantāṇī.”
“May the venerable Gagga Mantāṇīputta be happy.
I’ll make sure that you’re provided with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”
But at that time Venerable Aṅgulimāla lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, and owned just three robes.
So he said to the king,
“Enough, great king. My robes are complete.”
Then the king went back to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
How the Buddha tames those who are wild, pacifies those who are violent, and extinguishes those who are unextinguished!
For I was not able to tame him with the rod and the sword, but the Buddha tamed him without rod or sword.
Well, now, sir, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.”
“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”
Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then as he was wandering indiscriminately for alms-food he saw a woman undergoing a painful obstructed labor.
Seeing this, it occurred to him,
“Oh, beings suffer such filth!
Oh, beings suffer such filth!”
Then after wandering for alms in Sāvatthī, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
The Buddha said to him,
“Well then, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:
‘Ever since I was born, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”
“But sir, wouldn’t that be telling a deliberate lie?
For I have intentionally killed many living creatures.”
“In that case, Aṅgulimāla, go to that woman and say this:
‘Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.’”
“Yes, sir,” replied Aṅgulimāla. He went to that woman and said:
“Ever since I was born in the noble birth, sister, I don’t recall having intentionally taken the life of a living creature. By this truth, may both you and your baby be safe.”
Then that woman was safe, and so was her baby.
Then Aṅgulimāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Aṅgulimāla became one of the perfected.
Then Venerable Aṅgulimāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Now at that time someone threw a stone that hit Aṅgulimāla, someone else threw a stick, and someone else threw gravel.
Then Aṅgulimāla—with cracked head, bleeding, his bowl broken, and his outer robe torn—went to the Buddha.
The Buddha saw him coming off in the distance,
and said to him,
“Endure it, brahmin! Endure it, brahmin!
You’re experiencing in this life the result of deeds that might have caused you to be tormented in hell for many years, many hundreds or thousands of years.”
Later, Venerable Aṅgulimāla was experiencing the bliss of release while in private retreat.
On that occasion he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
“He who once was heedless,
but turned to heedfulness,
lights up the world,
like the moon freed from a cloud.
Someone whose bad deed
is supplanted by the good,
lights up the world,
like the moon freed from a cloud.
A young mendicant
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,
lights up the world,
like the moon freed from a cloud.
May even my enemies hear a Dhamma talk!
May even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddha’s teaching!
May even my enemies associate with those good people
who establish others in the Dhamma!
May even my enemies hear Dhamma at the right time,
from those who speak on acceptance,
praising acquiescence;
and may they follow that path!
For then they’d surely wish no harm
upon myself or others.
Having arrived at ultimate peace,
they’d look after creatures firm and frail.
For irrigators guide the water,
and fletchers straighten arrows;
carpenters carve timber—
but the astute tame themselves.
Some tame by using the rod,
some with goads, and some with whips.
But the poised one tamed me
without rod or sword.
My name is ‘Harmless’,
though I used to be harmful.
The name I bear today is true,
for I do no harm to anyone.
I used to be a bandit,
the notorious Aṅgulimāla.
Swept away in a great flood,
I went to the Buddha as a refuge.
I used to have blood on my hands,
the notorious Aṅgulimāla.
See the refuge I’ve found—
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated.
I’ve done many of the sort of deeds
that lead to a bad destination.
The result of my deeds has already hit me,
so I enjoy my food free of debt.
Fools and half-wits
devote themselves to negligence.
But the wise protect diligence
as their best treasure.
Don’t devote yourself to negligence,
or delight in sexual intimacy.
For if you’re diligent and practice absorption,
you’ll attain abundant happiness.
It was welcome, not unwelcome,
the advice I got was good.
Of teachings that are shared,
I encountered the best.
It was welcome, not unwelcome,
the advice I got was good.
I’ve attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.”
Middle Discourses
The Inquirer
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One to see whether he is a fully awakened Buddha or not.”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, a mendicant who is an inquirer, unable to comprehend another’s mind, should scrutinize the Realized One for two things—things that can be seen and heard:
‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’
Scrutinizing him they find that
nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.
They scrutinize further:
‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’
Scrutinizing him they find that
nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.
They scrutinize further:
‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’
Scrutinizing him they find that
clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.
They scrutinize further:
‘Did the venerable attain this skillful state a long time ago, or just recently?’
Scrutinizing him they find that
the venerable attained this skillful state a long time ago, not just recently.
They scrutinize further:
‘Are certain dangers found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown?’
For, mendicants, so long as a mendicant has not achieved fame and renown, certain dangers are not found in them.
But when they achieve fame and renown, those dangers appear.
Scrutinizing him they find that
those dangers are not found in that venerable mendicant who has achieved fame and renown.
They scrutinize further:
‘Is this venerable securely stopped or insecurely stopped?
Is the reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures that they’re free of greed because greed has ended?’
Scrutinizing him they find that
that venerable is securely stopped, not insecurely stopped.
The reason they don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that they’re free of greed because greed has ended.
If others should ask that mendicant,
‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,
‘Because, whether that venerable is staying in a community or alone, some people there are in a good state or a sorry state, some instruct a group, and some indulge in material pleasures, while others remain unsullied. Yet that venerable doesn’t look down on them for that.
Also, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
“I am securely stopped, not insecurely stopped. The reason I don’t indulge in sensual pleasures is that I’m free of greed because greed has ended.”’
Next, they should ask the Realized One himself about this,
‘Can anything corrupt be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’
The Realized One would answer,
‘Nothing corrupt can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’
‘Can anything mixed be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’
The Realized One would answer,
‘Nothing mixed can be seen or heard in the Realized One.’
‘Can anything clean be seen or heard in the Realized One or not?’
The Realized One would answer,
‘Clean things can be seen and heard in the Realized One.
I am that range and that territory, but I do not identify with that.’
A disciple ought to approach a teacher who has such a doctrine in order to listen to the teaching.
The teacher explains Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.
When they directly know a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how they were taught, the mendicant comes to a conclusion about the teachings. They have confidence in the teacher:
‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!’
If others should ask that mendicant,
‘But what reason and evidence does the venerable have for saying this?’
Answering rightly, the mendicant should say,
‘Reverends, I approached the Buddha to listen to the teaching.
He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides.
When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I had confidence in the Teacher:
“The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha! The teaching is well explained! The Saṅgha is practicing well!”’
When someone’s faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One in this manner, with these words and phrases, it’s said to be grounded faith that’s based on evidence.
It is firm, and cannot be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.
This is how to scrutinize the Realized One’s qualities.
But the Realized One has already been properly searched in this way by nature.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Moggallāna the Accountant
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Then the brahmin Moggallāna the Accountant went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see gradual progress
down to the last step of the staircase.
Among the brahmins we can see gradual progress
Among archers we can see gradual progress
Among us accountants, who earn a living by accounting, we can see gradual progress
For when we get an apprentice we first make them count:
‘One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens.’
We even make them count up to a hundred.
Is it possible to similarly describe a gradual training, gradual progress, and gradual practice in this teaching and training?”
“It is possible, brahmin.
Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all he’d make it get used to wearing the bit.
In the same way, when the Realized One gets a person for training they first guide them like this:
‘Come, mendicant, be ethical and restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.’
When they have ethical conduct, the Realized One guides them further:
‘Come, mendicant, guard your sense doors. When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve restraint over it.
When you hear a sound with your ears …
When you smell an odor with your nose …
When you taste a flavor with your tongue …
When you feel a touch with your body …
When you know a thought with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of mind, and achieve its restraint.’
When they guard their sense doors, the Realized One guides them further:
‘Come, mendicant, eat in moderation.
Reflect properly on the food that you eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
When they eat in moderation, the Realized One guides them further:
‘Come, mendicant, be committed to wakefulness. Practice walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying your mind from obstacles. In the evening, continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying your mind from obstacles.’
When they are committed to wakefulness, the Realized One guides them further:
‘Come, mendicant, have mindfulness and situational awareness. Act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.’
When they have mindfulness and situational awareness, the Realized One guides them further:
‘Come, mendicant, frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.’
And they do so.
After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there.
Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire.
Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will.
Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.
Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse.
Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.
They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
That’s how I instruct the mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary.
But for those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—these things lead to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness.”
When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha,
“When his disciples are instructed and advised like this by Master Gotama, do all of them achieve the ultimate goal, extinguishment, or do some of them fail?”
“Some succeed, while others fail.”
“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why, though extinguishment is present, the path leading to extinguishment is present, and Master Gotama is present to encourage them,
still some succeed while others fail?”
“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, brahmin?
Are you skilled in the road to Rājagaha?”
“Yes, I am.”
“What do you think, brahmin?
Suppose a person was to come along who wanted to go to Rājagaha.
He’d approach you and say:
‘Sir, I wish to go to Rājagaha.
Please point out the road to Rājagaha.’
Then you’d say to them:
‘Here, mister, this road goes to Rājagaha.
Go along it for a while, and you’ll see a certain village. Go along a while further, and you’ll see a certain town.
Go along a while further and you’ll see Rājagaha with its delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds.’
Instructed like this by you, they might still take the wrong road, heading west.
But a second person might come with the same question and receive the same instructions.
Instructed by you, they might safely arrive at Rājagaha.
What is the cause, brahmin, what is the reason why, though Rājagaha is present, the path leading to Rājagaha is present, and you are there to encourage them,
one person takes the wrong path and heads west, while another arrives safely at Rājagaha?”
“What can I do about that, Master Gotama?
I am the one who shows the way.”
“In the same way, though extinguishment is present, the path leading to extinguishment is present, and I am present to encourage them,
still some of my disciples, instructed and advised like this, achieve the ultimate goal, extinguishment, while some of them fail.
What can I do about that, brahmin?
The Realized One is the one who shows the way.”
When he had spoken, Moggallāna the Accountant said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not committed to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and stupid. Master Gotama doesn’t live together with these.
But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith. They’re not devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are committed to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise, not stupid. Master Gotama does live together with these.
Of all kinds of fragrant root, spikenard is said to be the best.
Of all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best.
Of all kinds of fragrant flower, jasmine is said to be the best.
In the same way, Master Gotama’s advice is the best of contemporary teachings.
Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
All the Defilements
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all defilements.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.
For one who knows and sees what?
Proper attention and improper attention.
When you pay improper attention, defilements arise, and once arisen they grow.
When you pay proper attention, defilements don’t arise, and those that have already arisen are given up.
Some defilements should be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by enduring, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing.
Defilements Given Up by Seeing
And what are the defilements that should be given up by seeing?
Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t understand to which things they should pay attention and to which things they should not pay attention.
So they pay attention to things they shouldn’t and don’t pay attention to things they should.
And what are the things to which they pay attention but should not?
They are the things that, when attention is paid to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow; the defilements of sensual desire,
desire to be reborn,
and ignorance.
These are the things to which they pay attention but should not.
And what are the things to which they do not pay attention but should?
They are the things that, when attention is paid to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements; the defilements of sensual desire,
desire to be reborn,
and ignorance.
These are the things to which they do not pay attention but should.
Because of paying attention to what they should not and not paying attention to what they should, unarisen defilements arise and arisen defilements grow.
This is how they attend improperly:
‘Did I exist in the past?
Did I not exist in the past?
What was I in the past?
How was I in the past?
After being what, what did I become in the past?
Will I exist in the future?
Will I not exist in the future?
What will I be in the future?
How will I be in the future?
After being what, what will I become in the future?’
Or they are undecided about the present thus:
‘Am I?
Am I not?
What am I?
How am I?
This sentient being—where did it come from?
And where will it go?’
When they attend improperly in this way, one of the following six views arises in them and is taken as a genuine fact.
The view: ‘My self exists in an absolute sense.’
The view: ‘My self does not exist in an absolute sense.’
The view: ‘I perceive the self with the self.’
The view: ‘I perceive what is not-self with the self.’
The view: ‘I perceive the self with what is not-self.’
Or they have such a view:
‘This self of mine is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms. This self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’
This is called a misconception, the thicket of views, the desert of views, the trick of views, the evasiveness of views, the fetter of views.
An uneducated ordinary person who is fettered by views is not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They’re not freed from suffering, I say.
But take an educated noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They understand to which things they should pay attention and to which things they should not pay attention.
So they pay attention to things they should and don’t pay attention to things they shouldn’t.
And what are the things to which they don’t pay attention and should not?
They are the things that, when attention is paid to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow; the defilements of sensual desire,
desire to be reborn,
and ignorance.
These are the things to which they don’t pay attention and should not.
And what are the things to which they do pay attention and should?
They are the things that, when attention is paid to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements; the defilements of sensual desire,
desire to be reborn,
and ignorance.
These are the things to which they do pay attention and should.
Because of not paying attention to what they should not and paying attention to what they should, unarisen defilements don’t arise and arisen defilements are given up.
They properly attend: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
And as they do so, they give up three fetters:
identity view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by seeing.
Defilements Given Up by Restraint
And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, lives restraining the faculty of the eye.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
Reflecting properly, they live restraining the faculty of the ear …
the nose …
the tongue …
the body …
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint do not arise when there is such restraint.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.
Defilements Given Up by Using
And what are the defilements that should be given up by using?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, makes use of robes:
‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’
Reflecting properly, they make use of almsfood:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
Reflecting properly, they make use of lodgings:
‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’
Reflecting properly, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick:
‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.
Defilements Given Up by Enduring
And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst.
They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.
Defilements Given Up by Avoiding
And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer.
Reflecting properly, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.
Defilements Given Up by Dispelling
And what are the defilements that should be given up by dispelling?
Take a mendicant who, reflecting properly, doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without dispelling these things do not arise when they are dispelled.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by dispelling.
Defilements Given Up by Developing
And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing?
It’s when a mendicant, reflecting properly, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness,
investigation of principles,
tranquility,
immersion,
and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed.
These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.
Now, take a mendicant who, by seeing, has given up the defilements that should be given up by seeing. By restraint, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint. By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By dispelling, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by dispelling. By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing.
They’re called a mendicant who lives having restrained all defilements, who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
At Naḷakapāna
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kosalans near Naḷakapāna in the Parrot Tree grove.
Now at that time several very well-known gentlemen had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in the Buddha—
The venerables Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, Koṇḍañña, Revata, Ānanda, and other very well-known gentlemen.
Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the mendicant Saṅgha.
Then the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about those gentlemen:
“Mendicants, those gentlemen who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in me—I trust they’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”
When this was said, the mendicants kept silent.
For a second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question.
For a third time, the mendicants kept silent.
Then it occurred to the Buddha,
“Why don’t I question just those gentlemen?”
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Anuruddha,
“Anuruddha and friends, I hope you’re satisfied with the spiritual life?”
“Indeed, sir, we are satisfied with the spiritual life.”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
It’s appropriate for gentlemen like yourselves, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to be satisfied with the spiritual life.
Since you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, black-haired, you could have enjoyed sensual pleasures; yet you have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness.
But you didn’t go forth because you were forced to by kings or bandits, or because you’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living.
Rather, didn’t you go forth thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering’?”
“Yes, sir.”
“But, Anuruddha and friends, when a gentleman has gone forth like this, what should he do?
Take someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is still occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.
That’s someone who doesn’t achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.
Take someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that. Their mind is not occupied by desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, doubt, discontent, and sloth.
That’s someone who does achieve the rapture and bliss that are secluded from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities, or something even more peaceful than that.
Is this what you think of me?
‘The Realized One has not given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.’”
“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.
We think of you this way:
‘The Realized One has given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.’”
“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends!
The Realized One has given up the defilements, the corruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future.
Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,
in the same way, the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future.
That’s why, after appraisal, he uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.
What do you think, Anuruddha and friends?
What advantage does the Realized One see in declaring the rebirth of his disciples who have passed away:
‘This one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there’?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“The Realized One does not declare such things for the sake of deceiving people or flattering them, nor for the benefit of possessions, honor, or popularity, nor thinking, ‘So let people know about me!’
Rather, there are gentlemen of faith who are full of sublime joy and gladness.
When they hear that, they apply their minds to that end.
That is for their lasting welfare and happiness.
Take a monk who hears this:
‘The monk named so-and-so has passed away.
The Buddha has declared that,
he was enlightened.’
And he’s either seen for himself, or heard from someone else, that that venerable
had such ethics, such qualities, such wisdom, such meditation, or such freedom.
Recollecting that monk’s faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom, he applies his mind to that end.
That’s how a monk lives at ease.

Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse With Sakuludāyī
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyī was residing together with a large assembly of wanderers in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Then it occurred to him,
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.
Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?”
Then the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers.
Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as
talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.
Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance,
and hushed his own assembly,
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
Here comes the ascetic Gotama.
The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet.
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”
Then those wanderers fell silent.
Then the Buddha approached Sakuludāyī,
who said to him,
“Come, Blessed One!
Welcome, Blessed One!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,
while Sakuludāyī took a low seat and sat to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Udāyī, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.
It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.
When I don’t come to the assembly, they sit and engage in all kinds of unworthy talk.
But when I have come to the assembly, they sit gazing up at my face alone, thinking,
‘Whatever the ascetic Udāyī teaches, we shall listen to it.’
But when the Buddha has come to the assembly, both myself and the assembly sit gazing up at your face, thinking,
‘Whatever the Buddha teaches, we shall listen to it.’”
“Well then, Udāyī, suggest something for me to talk about.”
“Master Gotama, a few days ago someone was claiming to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’
When I asked them a question about the past, they dodged the issue, distracted the discussion with irrelevant points, and displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness.
That reminded me of the Buddha:
‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’”
“But Udāyī, who was it that made such a claim and behaved in such a way?”
“It was Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, sir.”
