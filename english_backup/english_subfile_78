The gods of the Thirty-Three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice, where they spoke very highly of you.
They would like to see you.
I shall send a chariot harnessed with a thousand thoroughbreds for you, great king.
Mount the heavenly chariot, great king! Do not waver.’
King Nimi consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the king had consented, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from King Nimi and reappeared among the Thirty-Three gods.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali,
‘Come, dear Mātali, harness the chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds. Then go to King Nimi and say,
“Great king, this chariot has been sent for you by Sakka, lord of gods.
Mount the heavenly chariot, great king! Do not waver.”’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali. He did as Sakka asked, and said to the king,
‘Great king, this chariot has been sent for you by Sakka, lord of gods.
Mount the heavenly chariot, great king! Do not waver.
But which way should we go—the way of those who experience the result of bad deeds, or the way of those who experience the result of good deeds?’
‘Take me both ways, Mātali.’
Mātali brought King Nimi to the Hall of Justice.
Sakka saw King Nimi coming off in the distance,
and said to him:
‘Come, great king!
Welcome, great king!
The gods of the Thirty-Three who wanted to see you were sitting together in the Hall of Justice, where they spoke very highly of you.
The gods of the Thirty-Three would like to see you.
Enjoy divine glory among the gods!’
‘Enough, good sir. Send me back to Mithila right away.
That way I shall justly treat brahmins and householders, and people of town and country.
And I shall observe the sabbath on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.’
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali,
‘Come, dear Mātali, harness the chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds and send King Nimi back to Mithila right away.’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali, and did as Sakka asked.
And there King Nimi justly treated his people, and observed the sabbath.
Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Nimi addressed his barber,
‘My dear barber, when you see grey hairs growing on my head, please tell me.’
And all unfolded as before.
And having developed the four Brahmā meditations, when his body broke up, after death, King Nimi was reborn in a good place, a Brahmā realm.
But King Nimi had a son named Kaḷārajanaka.
He didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He broke that good practice.
He was their final man.
Ānanda, you might think,
‘Surely King Makhādeva, by whom that good practice was founded, must have been someone else at that time?’
But you should not see it like this.
I myself was King Makhādeva at that time.
I was the one who founded that good practice,
which was kept up by those who came after.
But that good practice doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the Brahmā realm.
But now I have founded a good practice that does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
And what is that good practice?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is the good practice I have now founded that leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
Ānanda, I say to you:
‘You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men.’
Whatever generation is current when such good practice is broken, he is their final man.
Ānanda, I say to you:
‘You all should keep up this good practice that I have founded. Do not be my final men.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Incredible and Amazing
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then after the meal, on return from alms-round, several senior mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them:
“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing, the power and might of a Realized One!
For he is able to know the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished, cut off proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and transcended suffering.
He knows the caste they were born in, and also their names, clans, conduct, teaching, wisdom, meditation, and freedom.”
When they said this, Venerable Ānanda said,
“The Realized Ones are incredible, reverends, and they have incredible qualities.
They’re amazing, and they have amazing qualities.”
But this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said,
“Well then, Ānanda, say some more about the incredible and amazing qualities of the Realized One.”
“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.’
This I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening remained in the host of Joyful Gods.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘For the whole of that life, the being intent on awakening remained in the host of Joyful Gods.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Mindful and aware, the being intent on awakening passed away from the host of Joyful Gods and was conceived in his mother’s womb.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he is conceived in his mother’s womb.
And then—in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.
Even in the boundless desolation of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.
And even the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light: “So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!”
And this galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, four deities approach to guard the four directions, so that no human or non-human or anyone at all shall harm the being intent on awakening or his mother.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she becomes naturally ethical. She refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she no longer feels sexual desire for men, and she cannot be violated by a man of lustful intent.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she obtains the five kinds of sensual stimulation and amuses herself, supplied and provided with them.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, complete with all his various parts, not deficient in any faculty.
Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked.
And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.
And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and examine it: “This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.”
In the same way, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, complete with all his various parts, not deficient in any faculty.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Seven days after the being intent on awakening is born, his mother passes away and is reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Other women carry the infant in the womb for nine or ten months before giving birth.
Not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She gives birth after exactly ten months.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘Other women give birth while sitting or lying down.
Not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She only gives birth standing up.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, gods receive him first, then humans.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, before he reaches the ground, four deities receive him and place him before his mother, saying: “Rejoice, O Queen! An illustrious son is born to you.”’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus, blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean.
Suppose a jewel-treasure was placed on a cloth from Kāsī. The jewel would not soil the cloth, nor would the cloth soil the jewel.
Why is that?
Because of the cleanliness of them both.
In the same way, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus, blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, two streams of water appear in the sky, one cool, one warm, for bathing the being intent on awakening and his mother.’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘As soon as he’s born, the being intent on awakening stands firm with his own feet on the ground.
Facing north, he takes seven strides with a white parasol held above him, surveys all quarters, and makes this dramatic proclamation: “I am the foremost in the world! I am the eldest in the world! I am the first in the world! This is my last rebirth. Now there are no more future lives.”’
This too I remember as an incredible quality of the Buddha.
I have learned this in the presence of the Buddha:
‘When the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, then—in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.
Even in the boundless desolation of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.
And the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light: “So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!”
And this galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods.’
This too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Buddha.”
“Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this as an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One.
It’s that the Realized One knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
This too you should remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One.”
“Sir, the Buddha knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away.
This too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Buddha.”
That’s what Ānanda said,
and the teacher approved.
Satisfied, those mendicants were happy with what Venerable Ānanda said.
Middle Discourses
With Bakkula
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Bakkula was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then the naked ascetic Kassapa, who had been a friend of Bakkula’s in the lay life, approached him, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Venerable Bakkula,
“Reverend Bakkula, how long has it been since you went forth?”
“It has been eighty years, reverend.”
“But in these eighty years, how many times have you had sex?”
“You shouldn’t ask me such a question.
Rather, you should ask me this:
‘But in these eighty years, how many times have sensual perceptions ever arisen in you?’”
“In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any sensual perception has ever arisen in me.”
“This we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
“In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any perception of ill will …
or cruelty has ever arisen in me.”
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
“In these eighty years, I don’t recall that any thought of sensuality …
ill will …
or cruelty has ever arisen in me.”
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
“In these eighty years, I don’t recall accepting a robe from a householder …
cutting a robe with a knife …
sewing a robe with a needle …
dying a robe …
sewing a robe during the robe-making ceremony …
looking for robe material for my companions in the spiritual life when they are making robes …
accepting an invitation …
having such a thought:
‘If only someone would invite me!’ …
sitting down inside a house …
eating inside a house …
getting caught up in the details of female’s appearance …
teaching a female, even so much as a four line verse …
going to the nuns’ quarters …
teaching the nuns …
teaching the trainee nuns …
teaching the novice nuns …
giving the going forth …
giving the ordination …
giving dependence …
being looked after by a novice …
bathing in the sauna …
bathing with bath powder …
looking for a massage from my companions in the spiritual life …
being ill, even for as long as it takes to pull a cow’s udder …
being presented with medicine, even as much as a bit of yellow myrobalan …
leaning on a headrest …
preparing a cot …”
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
“In these eighty years, I don’t recall commencing the rainy season residence in the neighborhood of a village.”
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
“Reverend, for seven days I ate the nation’s alms-food as a debtor.
Then on the eighth day I became enlightened.”
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.
Reverend Bakkula, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training?”
And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.
Then some time later Venerable Bakkula took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling, saying,
“Come forth, venerables, come forth! Today will be my final extinguishment.”
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
And Venerable Bakkula became fully extinguished while sitting right in the middle of the Saṅgha.
“This too we remember as an incredible quality of Venerable Bakkula.”
There are these seven Factors of Awakening, sisters, which when developed and made much of, a bhikkhu, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having directly experienced, and having attained (Nibbāna) himself in this very life.
‘Thus I have heard’, this is the Discourse giving Nandaka’s Advice.
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood.
Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī together with at least five hundred nuns
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, she stood on one side.
While standing on one side Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said this to the Fortunate One:
“The Fortunate One should advise the nuns, reverend Sir,
the Fortunate One should instruct the nuns, reverend Sir,
the Fortunate One should give a Dhamma talk to the nuns, reverend Sir.”
Then at that time
Herein, ‘Then at that time,’
when the Fortunate One was requested by Mahāpajāpatī, after sending the Community of nuns away,
and gathering the Community of monks,
saying: “Elder monks must instruct the nuns in turns,”
he gave this task to the Community.
It was said regarding this.
the Elder monks were advising the nuns in turns,
Herein, ‘In turns’ means in order.
but Venerable Nandaka did not wish to advise the nuns in (his) turn.
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda:
“Whose turn is it today, Ānanda, to advise the nuns?”
“Reverend Sir, it is Nandaka’s turn to advise the nuns,
(but) this venerable Nandaka does not wish to advise the nuns in (his) turn.”
‘Does not wish,’ means when his own turn arrived,
having gone to a faraway village, or having begun his needlework and so on,
he had him say: “This is surely an obstacle for him.”
But the Fortunate One gave this advice to the Elder Nandaka about taking turns.
Why?
For when those nuns saw the Elder their mind became tranquil and clear.
Therefore they liked to accept his advice, and liked to listen to his talk on Dhamma.
Therefore the Fortunate One (said):
“When Nandaka’s turn arrives he should give advice,
he should give a Dhamma talk,” it means he should give advice in his turn.
But if the Elder didn’t take his turn, why is that?
It seems that formerly those nuns had made up his harem when he had ruled over the Rose Apple Isle.
The Elder, knowing this through his knowledge of previous lives, thought:
‘Sitting in the midst of this Community of nuns
and bringing forward similes and reasons,
and being seen preaching the Dhamma,
(if) another monk who also had knowledge of previous lives looked at the reason for it,
° he might think he could say: “Venerable Nandaka up to this day did not send off his concubines,
this venerable is resplendent when surrounded by his concubines.”
Understanding this matter the Elder did not take his turn.
But understanding that it will be beneficial for the Elder to preach to those nuns, it seems,
the Fortunate One then addressed the venerable Nandaka.
In order to understand when these nuns were previously in his harem, there is this story:
Formerly, it seems, in Bāraṇasī there were five hundred male slave and five hundred female slaves,
and as these thousand people did their work together, they dwelt in one place.
At that time this Elder Nandaka was the senior male slave, and Gotamī was the senior female slave.
She was the senior male slave’s attendant, and was wise and learned.
The thousand people who were making meritorious deeds, acted together.
Then, as the time for the Rains Retreat was approaching,
five Independent Buddhas descended from mount Nandamūlaka to Isipatana,
wandered for alms in the city, and after going (back) to Isipatana,
thought: ‘We will ask for manual labour in order to prepare the huts for spending the Rains.’
Having wrapped the robe, they entered the city in the evening time,
and stood at the gate of the treasurer’s house.
The chief female slave took a waterpot and while going to the reservoir
saw the Independent Buddhas entering the city.
The treasurer, after hearing why they had come,
said: “You do not have our permission, please go!”
Then, as they were leaving the city,
the chief female slave, took her waterpot and seeing them entering,
put down the waterpot, worshipped, bent down, lifted up her face,
and asked: “Noble Ones, having just entered the city, why are you (now) leaving?”
“We came to ask for manual labour to prepare the huts for spending the Rains.”
“Did you receive it, venerable Sirs?”
“We did not receive it, lay woman.”
“But can these huts only be made by the powerful?
“Very well, venerable Sirs, we will build (them),
tomorrow please accept our almsfood,” and after inviting (them),
she led them to the water, took the waterpot, placed it on the road going to the reservoir,
and as the other female slaves came and went, she said: “Wait here,”
and when everyone had assembled, she said:
“Ladies, will we always be doing slave-work for another,
or do you wish to be free of this slavery?”
“Noble Lady, today itself we wish to be free.”
“When these five Independent Buddhas didn’t receive manual labour
they were invited by me for tomorrow.
They replied: “Very well!”
and informed their husbands when they returned from the forest.
They (also) said: “Very well!” and assembled at the chief male slave’s door.
Then the chief female slave said to them:
“Tomorrow, Dears, you must give manual labour to the Independent Buddhas,”
and she explained the advantages, and even those who did not desire to do it (at first),
after she had given them strong advice, agreed.
On the next day, after giving food to the Independent Buddhas,
she informed all the slaves.
They entered the wilderness straight away, assembled the timber,
gathered in hundreds, made each of them a hut together with a walking meditation path,
and placed suitable beds, chairs and drinks,
and made the Independent Buddhas promise to spend the three months
and prepared excellent almsfood (for them).
For those who were not able to take the opportunity (to give) on their day,
the chief female slave took (food) from her own house and gave it.
After looking after them for three months,
the chief female slave had each of the male slaves prepare cloth,
and they made five-hundred coarse cloths.
Those thousand people having done good deeds together,
at the break up of the body were reborn in the world of the gods.
Those five hundred women from time to time
were (reborn) in the homes of the five hundred men,
and from time to time all were (reborn) in the home of the chief male slave.
Then at one time the chief male slave, having fallen from the world of the gods, was reborn in a Princely family.
Those five hundred goddesses, after being reborn in very wealthy families,
ruled over his home, and then departed.
Transmigrating in this way, at the time of our Fortunate One
they were reborn in warrior families in the towns of Koliya and Devadaha.
After going forth the Elder Nandaka attained Liberation.
When the senior slave’s daughter came of age
she was established in the position of the Great King Suddhodana’s Chief Queen,
and the rest of them went to the houses of the Princes’ sons.
Their husbands, the five hundred Princes, at the end of the string of quarrels about water,
having heard the Teacher’s Dhamma teaching went forth,
and sent a message to those Princesses about their dissatisfaction.
The Fortunate One led those who were dissatisfied to the Kuṇāla Lake, established them in the fruit of Stream-Entry,
and on the day of the Great Assembly established them in Liberation.
The five hundred Princesses, having renounced,
went forth in the presence of Mahāpajāpatī.
So much for venerable Nandaka and the nuns:
This is how the story should be seen.
Then the Fortunate One addressed the venerable Nandaka:
“Advise the nuns, Nandaka, instruct the nuns, Nandaka,
give a Dhamma talk to the nuns, brāhmaṇa.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” and venerable Nandaka, having replied to the Fortunate One,
dressed in the morning time,
and picked up his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
After walking for alms in Sāvatthī, and while returning from the alms-round with his attendant after the meal,
he approached the King’s monastery.
‘The King’s monastery’ means the monastery that was built by (King) Pasenadi
in the southern part of the city (of Sāvatthī), in a position similar to the Thūpārāma.
Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming while still far away,
and having seen (him), they prepared a seat, and had water set up for (washing) the feet.
Venerable Nandaka sat down on the prepared seat, and while sitting he washed his feet.
Those nuns worshipped venerable Nandaka
and sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side venerable Nandaka said this to those nuns:
“Sisters, this will be a talk in which I put questions,
herein, when you understand, you should say: ‘We understand,’
when you don’t understand, you should say: ‘We don’t understand.’
But if for you there is doubt or uncertainty herein you should ask in return:
‘This that you said, reverend Sir, what is its meaning?’ ”
“So far, reverend Sir, we are uplifted and satisfied with the noble Nandaka,
and for the noble Nandaka making this invitation to us.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is the ear permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”

“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
Previously, reverend Sir, this was well seen by us, as it really is, with perfect wisdom:
‘Well seen ... with perfect wisdom,’
seen, at the time it really exists, with cause, with reason, with the wisdom of insight.
‘These six internal sense spheres are impermanent.’ ”
“Very good, very good, sisters!
This is the way, sisters,
for a noble disciple who sees it as it really is, with perfect wisdom.
What do you think of this, sisters, are forms permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”

What is the reason for that?
Previously, reverend Sir, this was well seen by us, as it really is, with perfect wisdom:

“Very good, very good, sisters!
This is the way, sisters,
for a noble disciple who sees it as it really is, with perfect wisdom.
What do you think of this, sisters, is eye-consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is ear-consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is nose-consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is tongue-consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is body-consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is mind-consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
Previously, reverend Sir, this was well seen by us, as it really is, with perfect wisdom:
‘These six kinds of consciousness are impermanent.’ ”
“Very good, very good, sisters!
This is the way, sisters,
for a noble disciple who sees it as it really is, with perfect wisdom.
Suppose, sisters, when an oil lamp is burning
the oil is impermanent and changeable,
the wick is impermanent and changeable,
the flame is impermanent and changeable,
‘For this oil lamp that is burning the oil is impermanent and changeable,
the wick is impermanent and changeable,
the flame is impermanent and changeable,
but the radiance is permanent, constant, eternal and unchangeable,’
would someone speaking in this way, sisters, be speaking correctly?”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
For while this oil lamp is burning, reverend Sir,
the oil is impermanent and changeable,
the wick is impermanent and changeable,
the flame is impermanent and changeable,
then what to say of its radiance being impermanent and changeable?”
“Just so he who would say this, sisters:
‘These six internal sense-spheres are impermanent,
but that which is conditioned by these six internal sense-spheres,
the pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant (feeling) that he feels,
that is permanent, constant, eternal and unchangeable,’
would someone speaking in this way, sisters, be speaking correctly?”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
Whatever arises, reverend Sir, is conditioned by conditions, and with that arising feelings appear.
‘Whatever arises’ means that which arises,
but the meaning is: ‘That which is conditioned by conditions, with just that feelings appear,’ this is what is said.
With the cessation of the conditions for whatever arises,
whatever feelings have arisen cease.”
“Very good, very good, sisters!
This is the way, sisters,
for a noble disciple who sees it as it really is, with perfect wisdom.
Suppose, sisters, when there is a big tree standing, having heartwood,
the root is impermanent and changeable,
the trunk is impermanent and changeable,
the branches and foilage are impermanent and changeable,
the shadow is impermanent and changeable.
He who would say this, sisters:
‘For this big tree which is stood here, having heartwood,
the root is impermanent and changeable,
the trunk is impermanent and changeable,
the branches and foilage are impermanent and changeable,
but the shadow is permanent, constant, eternal and unchangeable,’
would someone speaking in this way, sisters, be speaking correctly?”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
For this big tree which is stood here, reverend Sir, having heartwood,
the root is impermanent and changeable,
the trunk is impermanent and changeable,
the branches and foilage are impermanent and changeable,
then what to say of its shadow being impermanent and changeable?”
‘Then what to say of its shadow,’ of those things that exist because of the root and so on, the shadow is the most impermanent.
“Just so he who would say this, sisters:
‘These six external sense-spheres are impermanent,
but that which is conditioned by these six external sense-spheres
the pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant (feeling) that he feels,
that is permanent, constant, eternal and unchangeable,’
would someone speaking in this way, sisters, be speaking correctly?”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
Whatever arises, reverend Sir, is conditioned by conditions,
and with that arising feelings appear.
With the cessation of the conditions for whatever arises,
whatever feelings have arisen cease.”
“Very good, very good, sisters!
This is the way, sisters,
for a noble disciple who sees it as it really is, with perfect wisdom,
Suppose, sisters,
a butcher or a butcher’s apprentice, after killing a cow,
were to cut through the cow with a sharp butcher’s knife,
without harming the flesh on the inside, and without harming the hide on the outside,
‘Without harming’ means without harming (different word form).
Herein, by making balls of meat
the hide sticking to the flesh is damaged;
by kneading the hide,
the flesh sticking to the hide is damaged.
Without doing this.
(but) whatever was right there, the flesh stuck to the inside, the sinew on the inside, the teguments on the inside,
‘Flesh stuck to the inside, the sinew, the teguments,’ means the flesh stuck and smeared on the hide.
(all) that he were to cut away from the cow with a sharp butcher’s knife,
were to cut it through, were to cut it out,
and after having cut it away, cut it through, cut it out,
and removed the hide on the outside,
and with the hide having covered that cow (again), were he to say thus:
‘This cow is connected with its hide (again),’
would someone speaking in this way, sisters, be speaking correctly?”
“Certainly not, reverend Sir.
What is the reason for that?
For, reverend Sir, (if) a butcher or a butcher’s apprentice, after killing a cow,
were to cut through the cow with a sharp butcher’s knife,
without harming the flesh on the inside, and without harming the hide on the outside,
and whatever was right there, the flesh stuck to the inside, the sinew on the inside, the teguments on the inside,
(all) that he were to cut away from the cow with a sharp butcher’s knife,
were to cut it through, were to cut it out,
and after having cut it away, cut it through, cut it out,
and removed the hide on the outside,
and with the hide having covered that cow (again), were he to say thus:
‘This cow is connected with its hide (again),’
still that cow would not be connected with its hide (again).”
“This is a simile I have made, sisters, to instruct in the meaning,
and this is the meaning here:
‘Flesh on the inside,’ sisters,
that is a designation for these six internal sense spheres,
‘Hide on the outside,’ sisters,
that is a designation for these six external sense spheres,
‘The flesh stuck to the inside, the sinew on the inside, the teguments on the inside,’ sisters,
that is a designation for enjoyment and passion,
‘A sharp butcher’s knife,’ sisters,
that is a designation for noble wisdom,
° the noble wisdom that cuts away the internal defilements,
the internal fetters, the internal bonds,
‘The internal defilements, fetters and bonds,’ this was said in regard to all the internal defilements.
cuts them through, cuts them out.
There are these seven Factors of Awakening, sisters,
‘There are these seven,’ why was this said?
‘For this wisdom cuts the defilements,’ is said,
(but) as a general rule it is not able to cut (them) by itself.
Just as an axe as a general rule cannot cut what can be cut by itself,
but on account of a man’s endeavour it cuts,
so without the other six Factors of Awakening wisdom
Therefore this was said.

a monastic, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom,

Which seven?
Here, sisters, a monastic develops the Mindfulness Factor of Complete Awakening,
develops the Investigation (of the Nature) of Things Factor of Complete Awakening,
develops the Energy Factor of Complete Awakening,
develops the Joy Factor of Complete Awakening,
develops the Tranquility Factor of Complete Awakening,
develops the Concentration Factor of Complete Awakening,
develops the Equanimity Factor of Complete Awakening,

There are these seven Factors of Awakening, sisters,

Then venerable Nandaka, having advised the nuns with this advice, sent them off,
saying: “Depart, sisters, it is time.”
Then those nuns,
after rejoicing in and being gladdened by venerable Nandaka’s speech,
rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating venerable Nandaka,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, they stood on one side.
While they were standing on one side the Fortunate One said this to the nuns:
“Depart, sisters, it is time.”
Then those nuns, after worshipping
and circumambulating the Fortunate One, departed.
Then, not long after those nuns had departed, the Fortunate One addressed the monks:
saying: “Just as, monks, on the Uposatha day of the fourteenth
for most people there is no doubt or uncertainty:
‘Is the moon deficient, or is the moon full?’
for then the moon is deficient;
just so, monks, those nuns
were uplifted by the venerable Nandaka’s Dhamma preaching,
but their aspirations were not fulfilled.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the venerable Nandaka,
saying: “Nandaka, tomorrow also you should advise the nuns with just this advice.”
‘With ... this,’ with this reasoning on the six internal sense spheres,
the six external (sense spheres), the six kinds of consciousness,
and concluding the teaching with the destruction of the pollutants through the seven Factors of Awakening,
with this reasoning you should advise the nuns tomorrow with this advice.
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Nandaka replied to the Fortunate One.
Then when the night had passed, venerable Nandaka, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
After walking for alms in Sāvatthī, and while returning from the alms-round with his attendant after the meal,
he approached the King’s monastery.
The nuns saw
the venerable Nandaka coming while still far away,
and having seen (him), they prepared a seat, and had water set up for (washing) the feet.
Venerable Nandaka sat down on the prepared seat, and while sitting he washed his feet.
Those nuns worshipped venerable Nandaka
and sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side venerable Nandaka said this to those nuns:
“Sisters, this will be a talk in which I put questions,
herein, when you understand, you should say: ‘We understand,’
when you don’t understand, you should say: ‘We don’t understand.’
But if for you there is doubt or uncertainty herein you should ask in return:
‘This that you said, reverend Sir, what is its meaning?’ ”
“So far, reverend Sir, we are uplifted and satisfied with the noble Nandaka,
and for the noble Nandaka making this invitation to us.”
“What do you think of this, sisters, is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, is that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, reverend Sir.”
“But that which is unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:

“Certainly not, reverend Sir.”

Suppose, sisters, when an oil lamp is burning
the oil is impermanent and changeable,

Then venerable Nandaka, having advised the nuns with this advice, sent them off,
saying: “Depart, sisters, it is time.”
Then those nuns
after rejoicing in and being gladdened by venerable Nandaka’s speech,
rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating venerable Nandaka,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, they stood on one side.
While they were standing on one side the Fortunate One said this to the nuns:
“Depart, sisters, it is time.”
Then those nuns, after worshipping
and circumambulating the Fortunate One, departed.
Then, not long after those nuns had departed, the Fortunate One addressed the monks:
saying: “Just as, monks, on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth
for most people there is no doubt or uncertainty:
‘Is the moon deficient, or is the moon full?’
for then the moon is full;
just so, monks, those nuns
were uplifted by the venerable Nandaka’s Dhamma preaching,
and their aspirations were fulfilled.
For those five hundred nuns, monks,
the least nun is a Stream-Enterer,
‘A Stream-Enterer,’ the quality of the very least of all is a Stream-Enterer.
The rest are Once-Returners, Non-Returners and those who Destroyed the Pollutants.
How are their aspirations said to be fulfilled?
Through the fulfilment of their intentions.
To the nun that this (thought) occurred:
‘When I am listening to the noble Nandaka’s teaching of Dhamma
on that very seat I can realise Stream-Entry,’ she did realise Stream-Entry.
To her whom this (thought) occurred: ‘The fruit of Once-Returner, the fruit of Non-Returner and the fruit of the Destruction of the Pollutants,’
she realised Liberation.
Therefore the Fortunate One said: “(They) were uplifted and their aspirations were fulfilled.”
no longer subject to falling away, sure and destined for Full Awakening.”
The Fortunate One said this,
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One.
In the seventh (story), “Amongst those who advise the nuns, that is to say, Nandaka,”
while this Elder monk was giving a talk on Dhamma
altogether five hundred nuns attained Liberation.
Therefore he became known as the foremost amongst those who advise the nuns.
This is the exposition concerning the enquiry into his (previous) deeds:
At the time of the Buddha Padumuttara,
he was reborn in a good family house in Haṁsavatī,
and while listening to the Teacher’s teaching of the Dhamma,
he saw the Teacher set a certain monk aside as being foremost amongst those who advise the nuns,
did a great deed, and aspired for that position himself.
He did wholesome (deeds) for the rest of his life, and being reborn amongst gods and humans (only),
when this (Gotama) Buddha arose, after being conceived in a good family home in Sāvatthī,
when he was mature he heard the Teacher teach the Dhamma,
gained faith and went forth in the presence of the Teacher,
developed insight and attained Liberation,
and became one who had mastered knowledge of his former lives.
Within the four assemblies
(it was said): “He was able to preach so as to capture everyone’s mind,”
and he became known as Nandaka the Dhamma Preacher.
The Realised One departed from the string of quarrels on the bank of the River Rohiṇī,
and discontent having arisen for the five hundred Sākiyan Princes who went forth,
he took those monks and went to the Kuṇāla Lake,
and understanding their spiritual anxiety because of the talk on the Kuṇāla Birth Story,
and preaching a talk on the Four Truths, he established them in the fruit of Stream-Entry.
Later he preached the Discourse on the Great Assembly and made them attain the supreme fruit of Liberation.
Those Elders’ former wives
saying: “What do we have to do here now?”
had but one thought, and after approaching Mahāpajāpatī they requested the going forth.
In the presence of that Elder nun all five hundred received the going forth and the higher ordination.
In his immediately past life
they all had been the wives of the Elder Nandaka when he was a Prince.
At that time the Teacher said: “Monks must advise the nuns.”
When the Elder’s turn arrived,
knowing they were his wives in a previous existence he thought:
‘Sitting in the midst of this Community of nuns
and bringing forward similes and reasons,
and being seen preaching the Dhamma,
(if) another monk who also had knowledge of previous lives looked at the reason for it,
he might think he could say: “Venerable Nandaka up to this day did not send off his concubines,
this venerable is resplendent when surrounded by his concubines.”
Therefore when it came to his (turn) he sent another monk.
But those five hundred nuns desired the Elder’s advice.
For this reason the Fortunate One
said to the Elder monk: “When your turn arrives, without sending another,
having gone yourself, advise the Community of nuns.”
He was unable to refuse the Teacher’s speech,
and when his turn arrived on the fourteenth he gave advice to the Community of nuns,
and with a Dhamma teaching elaborating on the six sense spheres
he established all the nuns in the fruit of Stream-Entry.
Those nuns, being uplifted by the Elder’s Dhamma teaching,
went into the presence of the Teacher and informed him of their penetration (of the Dhamma).
The Teacher thought: ‘With what Dhamma teaching
will these nuns attain the further Paths and Fruits?’
and reflecting further: ‘Listening again to Nandaka’s Dhamma teaching surely
these five hundred will attain Liberation.’
Having seen (that), on another day he sent them into the Elder’s presence to listen to the Dhamma,
and on that day they listened to Dhamma and attained Liberation.
On that day the Fortunate One came into the presence of those nuns,
he understood (they had attained) the fruition state with that Dhamma teaching,
and he said: “Nandaka’s Dhamma teaching yesterday, was like the moon on the fourteenth day,
today it is like the moon on the fifteenth day,”
and having given his approval to the Elder monk, for that reason as the occasion had arisen,
he placed this Elder monk in the foremost position amongst those who advise the nuns.

“(To) the one who points out the past, said venerable Posāla,
who is perfect in everything, I have come in need with a question:
For the one in whom perception of form has ended,
(who), on the inside and outside is seeing ‘there is nothing whatsoever’,
I ask about (his) knowledge, Sakyan, how is such a one led further?”
“All the stations of consciousness, Posāla, said the Fortunate One,
he knows where that one stands, what he is intent on, what he is going towards.
Having known the origin of nothingness, and that enjoyment is called a fetter,
knowing deeply that it is so, and then having insight into this:
this is real knowedge for him, for the brahmin who is accomplished.”
“I ask you, Fortunate One, please tell this to me, said venerable Dhotaka,
I am waiting for a word of yours, Great Seer,
having heard your utterance I could train for my own Nibbāna.”
“Then you must become ardent, Dhotaka said the Fortunate One,
henceforth, after hearing this utterance you should train for your own Nibbāna.”
“I see in the world with its gods and men, said venerable Dhotaka,
a brahmin who moves about having nothing,
therefore I revere you, All-Seeing Visionary,
O Sakyan, please free me from my doubts.”
“I will not be able to free
anyone in the world who is having doubts,
but knowing (Nibbāna), the best thing,
in this way you can cross over the flood.”
“Brahmin! Being compassionate teach, said venerable Dhotaka,
the state of detachment that I should know,
then I, being undisturbed, just like the sky,
may live peaceful and independent right here.”
“I shall proclaim the peace to you, Dhotaka, said the Fortunate One,
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”
“I greatly rejoice in that supreme peace, Great Seer,
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”
“Whatever you know, Dhotaka, said the Fortunate One,
above, below, and across the middle,
having understood this is called a shackle in the world,
you must not have craving for repeated existence.”
“‘There are sages in the world’, said venerable Nanda,
that is what people say - how is this so?
Do they say he is a sage because he has knowledge
Or because of the life he leads?”
“Not by view, tradition, or knowledge,
do the skilful say one is a sage here, Nanda,
whoever lives without company, not troubled,
not yearning, they are sages, I say.”
“Whoever (among) these ascetics and brahmins, said venerable Nanda,
say that purity is through what is seen or heard,
say that purity is through virtue and practices,
say that purity is through countless (other) ways,
Fortunate One, perhaps those living restrained in this way
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?
I ask you, Fortunate One, please tell this to me.”
“Whoever (among) these ascetics and brahmins, Nanda, said the Fortunate One,
say that purity is through what is seen or heard,
say that purity is through virtue and practices,
say that purity is through countless (other) ways,
although they are living restrained in this way,
they have not crossed over bith and old age, I say.”
“Whoever (among) these ascetics and brahmins, said venerable Nanda,
say that purity is through what is seen or heard,
say that purity is through virtue and practices,
say that purity is through countless (other) ways,
if you say these sages have not crossed the flood,
then just who in the world of the gods and men
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?
I ask you, Fortunate One, please tell this to me.”
“I do not say that all ascetics and brahmins, Nanda, said the Fortunate One,
are enveloped in birth and old age:
whoever here has given up (reliance on) what is seen,
heard, or sensed, and virtue and practices,
and has also given up all the countless (other) ways,
who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free -
I say those men have crossed over the flood.”
I greatly rejoice in the great seer’s word,
Gotama, well-proclaimed is freedom from cleaving!
Whoever here has given up (reliance on) what is seen,
heard, or sensed, and virtue and practices,
and has also given up all the countless (other) ways,
who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free -
I also say they have crossed over the flood.”
“Those who explained (things) to me in the past, said venerable Hemaka,
saying ‘it was so, and so it will be’, all that was just hearsay,
all that just increased my thoughts, and I did not delight therein.
You must explain the Teaching to me, O Sage, and the destruction of craving,
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”
“In regard to likeable forms here seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, Hemaka,
the dispelling of desire and passion (for them) - this is the undying Nibbāna.
Knowing this, those who are mindful, who are Emancipated
those who are always peaceful, have crossed over clinging to the world.”
“For those standing in the middle of a lake, said venerable Kappa,
for those overcome by old age and death, speak (about) an island, dear Sir,
you must explain an island to me, so there will be no more after this.”
“For those standing in the middle of a lake, Kappa, said the Fortunate One,
for those overcome by old age and death, I speak (about) an island, Kappa:
having nothing, no attachment, this is the island with nothing beyond,
this is called Nibbāna, I say, the end of old age and death.
Knowing this, those who are mindful, who are emancipated in this very life,
come not under Māra’s control, they are not servants to Māra.”
“Who is satisfied here in the world? said venerable Tissa Metteyya,
Who is the wise man, who has known both ends, and is undefiled in the middle?
Who do you say is a Great Man? Who has gone beyond the seamstress here?”
“He who is chaste in regard to sense pleasures, Metteyya, said the Fortunate One,
having discernment
He is the wise man, who has known both ends, and is undefiled in the middle.
He, I say, is a Great Man, he has gone beyond the seamstress here.”
“He who has no in-dwelling sense desires, said venerable Todeyya,
he who crossed beyond doubts, what kind of freedom is there for him?”
“He who has no in-dwelling sense desires, said the Fortunate One,
he who has crossed beyond doubts, there is no further freedom for him.”
“Is he without yearning, or is he still yearning? said venerable Todeyya,
Is he wise, or is he still acquiring wisdom?
I would know just what the sage is like, Sakyan:
Explain that to me, All-Seeing Visionary.”
“He is without yearning, he is not still yearning.
He is wise, he is not still acquiring wisdom.
Know that the Sage is just like this, Todeyya:
he has nothing, and is not clinging to sense existence.”
“The home-leaver, the craving-cutter, the unmoved one, said venerable Bhadrāvudha,
the enjoyment-leaver, the flood-crosser, the free one,
the speculation-leaver, the intelligent one - (him) I beg,
after hearing the Strong One, they will go away from here.
Various people have come from the countries,
and are waiting for your saying, O hero,
you must explain (the Teaching) properly to them,
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”
“You must remove all attachment to craving, Bhadrāvudha, said the Fortunate One,
above, below, and across the middle,
for with whatever they are attached to in the world,
with just that Māra follows a man.
Therefore knowing (this), the mindful monk should
not be attached to anything in the whole world,
seeing that with what is called attachment to clinging,
these people are clinging to the realm of Death.”
“I ask you, Fortunate One, please tell this to me, said venerable Mettagū,
I think you have true understanding, and a developed self -
how have these countless kinds of suffering
arisen for whoever is in the world?”
“You asked me about the origin of suffering, Mettagū said the Fortunate One,
as I know it I will declare it to you:
Because of clinging to a basis
of suffering originate for whoever is in the world.
The foolish one, without wisdom, clings to a basis,
and comes to suffering again and again, the fool.
Therefore knowing this, do not cling to a basis,
seeing the birth and origin of suffering.”
“You have proclaimed to us what we asked you about, said venerable Mettagū,
another thing we ask, come on, please answer it:
How do the wise ones cross over the flood
of birth, old age, grief, and lamentation?
Please explain this to me, O sage,
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”
“I shall proclaim the Teaching to you, Mettagū said the Fortunate One,
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”
“I greatly rejoice in that supreme Teaching, great seer,
which, having understood, and living mindfully, one can cross over clinging to the world.”
“Whatever you know, Mettagū said the Fortunate One,
above, below, and across the middle,
dispel the enjoyment of, and settling on, these things,
and consciousness,
Living in this way, mindful, and heedful,
the monk who lives on after giving up loved things,
can, being wise, give up birth, old age,
grief, lamentation, and suffering right here.”
“I greatly rejoice in this, the Great Seer’s word, said venerable Mettagū,
O Gotama, well proclaimed is freedom from cleaving.
Surely the Fortunate One gave up suffering,
for this Teaching has been understood by you.
Surely they too can give up suffering,
whomever you would continually advise, O Sage,
therefore having met the Strong One, I revere him,
perhaps the Fortunate One could continuously advise me!”
“You should know the brahmin who has true understanding, Mettagū, said the Fortunate One,
who has nothing, and is not clinging to sense existence,
for he has surely crossed over the flood,
without hindrance or doubt, he has crossed beyond.
That man here who is wise, and has true understanding,
who has released the shackle of repeated existence,
he is craving-free, not troubled, not yearning -
he has crossed over birth and old age, I say.”
“To the one who is unmoved, who sees the root,
On account of what did the seers and men,
nobles, and brahmins, here in the world
offer many sacrifices to the gods?
“Whoever of those seers and men, Puṇṇaka, said the Fortunate One,
nobles, and brahmins, here in the world,
offered many sacrifices to the gods,
“Whoever of those seers and men, said venerable Puṇṇaka,
nobles, and brahmins, here in the world
offered many sacrifices to the gods,
O Fortunate One, perhaps those heedful of the path of sacrifice
have crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?
I ask you, Fortunate One, please tell this to me.”
“They yearn and they praise, they hunger, and they offer, said the Fortunate One to Puṇṇaka,
They hunger for sense pleasures, because of gain
they engage in sacrifice, excited by the passion for existence.
They have not crossed over birth and old age, I say.”
“If those engaged in sacrifice have not crossed over, said venerable Puṇṇaka,
birth and old age by their sacrifices, dear Sir,
then just who in the world of the Gods and men
has crossed over birth and old age, dear Sir?
I ask you, Fortunate One, please tell this to me.”
“The one who has discerned far and near in the world, said the Fortunate One to Puṇṇaka,
who has no turmoil anywhere in the world,
who is peaceful, not incensed, not troubled, not yearning,
he has crossed over birth and old age, I say”
“To the meditator who sits dust-free, said venerable Udaya,
who is perfect in all things, I have come in need with a question:
please tell of freedom through knowledge, the breaking up of ignorance.”
“The giving up of sensual desire, Udaya, said the Fortunate One,
the dispelling of sloth, and the constraint of worry (about wrong-doing),
purity through equanimity and mindfulness,
this I call freedom through knowledge, the breaking up of ignorance.”
“By what is the world fettered? said venerable Udaya,
By completely giving up what thing is there what is called Nibbāna?”
“The world is fettered by enjoyment, Udaya, said the Fortunate One,
By completely giving up craving there is what is called Nibbāna.”
For he who lives mindfully, how is it consciousness ceases?
We have come to ask the Fortunate One, therefore may we hear your word.”
“Without rejoicing over feeling on the inside or outside -
for he who lives mindfully in this way, consciousness ceases.”
“By what is the world enveloped? said venerable Ajita,
What do you say is its defilement? What is (the world’s) great fear?”
“The world is enveloped by ignorance, Ajita, said the Fortunate One,
Hunger
“Streams are flowing everywhere,
Tell me the restraint for streams; by what are the streams shut off?”
“Whatever streams there are in the world, Ajita, said the Fortunate One,
That is the restraint for streams, I say; by wisdom they are shut off.”
“Wisdom and also mindfulness, said venerable Ajita,
please tell me this when asked: where does this cease?”
“This question that was asked, Ajita, I can answer it!
As to where mind and body ceases without remainder:
with the cessation of consciousness,
“Those who have discerned the Teaching, and the many in training here,
when I ask the prudent one, please tell me their conduct, dear Sir.”
“He should not be greedy for sense pleasures, or be disturbed in mind.
Skilful in all things, the monk should wander mindfully.”
“I will recite the Way to the Beyond, said venerable Piṅgiya,
as he saw it, so he explained: unstained, with great intelligence,
the one free from sense desire, the unentangled one, the Strong One, why should he speak falsely?
Of the one who gave up stain and delusion, who gave up conceit and malevolence,
come now, I will proclaim this lyric which is endowed with beauty:
The Buddha, the darkness-dispeller, the All-Seeing Visionary,
who has gone to the end of the world, transcended all of existence
given up all suffering, the one pollutant-free,
whose very name is truth - O brahmin, (you are) worshipped by me.
Just as a bird who has given up a barren woodland,
might live in a forest which has much fruit,
so too I have given up those of little wisdom,
like a swan who has arrived at the great sea.
Those who explained (things) to me in the past, before Gotama’s teaching,
saying ‘it was so, and so it will be’, all that was just hearsay,
all that just increased my thoughts.
Alone sits the Darkness-Dispeller, the Bright One, the Light-Maker,
Gotama of Great Knowledge, Gotama of Great Intelligence.
He who taught the Teaching to me, which is visible, not subject to time,
the end of craving, beyond calamity, for which there is nowhere a likeness.”
[Bāvari:] “Then why do you dwell apart from him, even for a second, Piṅgiya,
from Gotama of Great Knowledge, Gotama of Great Intelligence,
he who taught the Teaching to you, which is visible, not subject to time,
the end of craving, beyond calamity, for which there is nowhere a likeness?”
“I would not dwell apart from him even for a second, brahmin,
from Gotama of Great Knowledge, Gotama of Great Intelligence,
he who taught the Teaching to me, which is visible, not subject to time,
the end of craving, beyond calamity, for which there is nowhere a likeness.
I see him in my mind as though with the eye,
(as I dwell) heedful night and day, brahmin.
revering him I make the night pass by,
for that reason I think there is no (real) dwelling apart.
My confidence, happiness, mind, and mindfulness,
do not depart from Gotama’s teaching,
whatever direction the One of Great Wisdom goes to
it is that very place that I am inclined.
I am old, without strength and feeble,
because of that my body does not go there,
but by an effort of thought I always go,
for my mind, Brahmin, is joined to him.
Lying down in a quagmire I was trembling,
then I saw the Sambuddha, the flood-crosser, the one pollutant-free.”
[The Buddha:] “Just as Vakkali released his confidence -
and Bhadrāvudha, and Āḷavi-gotama -
just like that you must release your confidence,
and you will go, Piṅgiya, beyond the realm of Death.”
“I am more and more sure about this, having heard the sage’s word,
the cover-remover, the Sambuddha, who is unhindered, assured in speech,
who knows the great gods, who has understood everything far and near,
the Teacher who makes an end to questions in those who have doubts, and make them known.
The Indestructible, the Unagitated, for which there is nowhere a likeness,
Surely I will go there, about this I have no doubt,
thus bear me in mind as one whose heart is intent (on Nibbāna).”
“I am old, without strength, with poor complexion,  said venerable Piṅgiya,
my eyes are unclear, and hearing is difficult -
may I indeed not perish a fool mid-way!
Explain the Teaching so that I may know
the complete giving up of birth and old age here.”
“Having seen (people) being struck down amid forms,  Piṅgiya, said the Fortunate One,
(and that) heedless people are pained amid forms -
therefore you, Piṅgiya, being heedful,
must give up form, and not come into existence again.”
“The four directions, the four intermediate directions,  said venerable Piṅgiya,
above and below: in these ten directions,
there is nothing for you that is unseen, unheard,
unsensed, or uncognized in the world!
Explain the Teaching so that I may know
the complete giving up of birth and old age here.”
“Seeing human beings, victims of craving,  Piṅgiya, said the Fortunate One,
are tormented, and overcome by old age -
therefore you, Piṅgiya, being heedful,
must give up craving and not come into existence again.”
This was said by the Fortunate One while living among the Magadhans at the Pāsāṇaka shrine.
The sixteen attendant brahmins requested,
asked, and asked, and he answered the questions.
If, knowing the meaning of each question,
knowing the Teaching, he would practice in conformity with the Teaching,
he would surely go beyond old age and death.
It is said these teachings go to the beyond,
therefore this presentation of the Teaching
is indeed called The Way to the Beyond.
Ajita, Tissa Metteyya, Puṇṇaka, also Mettagū,
Dhotaka, and Upasīva, Nanda, and also Hemaka,
the two: Todeyya, and Kappa, and Jatukaṇṇī, the one who is wise,
Bhadrāvudha, and Udaya, also the brahmin Posāla,
Mogharāja, the intelligent one, and the great seer Piṅgiya.
These went to the Buddha, to the seer with perfect conduct,
asking subtle questions, they went to the Buddha who is best.
The Buddha answered as it truly is the questions that they asked,
and by answering the questions the sage satisfied those brahmins.
They, being satisfied by the Visionary, the Buddha, the kinsman of the sun,
lived the spiritual life under the One With Excellent Wisdom.
The Buddha taught like this (in response) to the questions one by one,
he who practices like this can go from here to the beyond.
From here to the beyond he can go by developing the supreme path.
This is the path for going to the beyond, therefore it is called The Way to the Beyond.
“Twice I asked the Sakyan, said venerable Mogharāja,
if (asked) up to a third time the Divine Seer answers, I have heard.
This world, the other world, the Brahma world with its Gods:
one does not know what view of this the reputable Gotama has.
So, to the One With Excellent Sight, I have come in need with a question:
Looking on the world in what way does the king of Death not see (one)?
“Look on the world as empty,
Having removed (wrong) view of self, in this way one will cross beyond Death.
When looking on the world in this way the king of Death does not see (one).”
“Alone, Sakyan, with nothing to depend on, said venerable Upasīva,
I am not able to cross over the great flood.
Please tell me of a support, All-Seeing Visionary,
depending on which I can cross over this flood.”
“Looking to nothingness, and being mindful, Upasīva, said the Fortunate One,
depending on nothing, cross over the flood.
Having given up sense pleasures, abstaining from talk,
day and night you must look for the end of suffering.”
“He who is passionless regarding all sense pleasures, said venerable Upasīva,
who is depending on nothingness, having given up all else,
intent on the highest freedom which still has perception -
will he remain there without going away?”
“He who is passionless regarding all sense pleasures, Upasīva, said the Fortunate One,
who is depending on nothingness, having given up all else,
intent on the highest freedom which still has perception -
he will remain there without going away.”
“If he remains there without going away
for a great number of years, All-Seeing Visionary,
will he become cool and free right there,
or will the consciousness of such a one fall away?”
“As a flame overthrown by the force of the wind, Upasīva, said the Fortunate One,
goes to rest and can no longer be discerned,
just so the Sage free from the mental body
goes to rest and can no longer be discerned.”
“The one who has come to rest, is he then nothing? said venerable Upasīva,
or is he actually eternally healthy?
Please explain this to me, O Sage,
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”
“There is no measure of the one who has come to rest, Upasīva, said the Fortunate One,
there is nothing by which they can speak of him,
when everything has been completely removed,
all the pathways for speech are also completely removed.”
From the delightful city of the Kosalans
one who wanted to have no possessions, a brahmin perfect in the Vedas.
In the locality of Assaka, and near to Mūḷaka,
close to the bank of the Godhāvari he lived on gleanings and fruit.
In the vicinity (of the river) there was a large village,
and with the income that arose from that he offered a great sacrifice.
When that great sacrifice had been given he entered his hermitage again,
and when he had re-entered it, another brahmin came along -
he had sore feet, and was thirsty, with dirty teeth, and dust on his head -
and after approaching (the first brahmin), he begged for five hundred (coins).
After seeing him Bāvari invited him to take a seat,
and he asked after his happiness and welfare, and this is the word he spoke:
“Whatever kind of gift I had, all that has been given away by me,
please excuse me brahmin, I do not have the five hundred.”
“If your honour will not give me what I am begging for,
then within seven days may your head split into seven pieces!”
Having made (a scene) the dishonest man proclaimed this fearful thing.
After hearing this word of his, Bāvari became miserable.
(Going) without food he dried up, and was affected by the dart of grief,
and when his heart was like that his mind did not delight in meditation.
Having seen him terrified and miserable, a God
approached Bāvari, and this is the word he spoke:
“He does not know the head - he is a dishonest man who wants wealth!
He does not have knowledge about the head or head-splitting.”
“But now your honour knows! Please explain this to me when asked:
the head and head-splitting, may we hear that word of yours.”
“I also do not know about this, I do not have this knowledge here.
The head and head-splitting! Indeed only Victors
“Then who knows about the head and head-splitting
on the face of the earth? O God, please explain this to me.”
“From out of the city of Kapilavatthu a world leader has renounced,
he is of king Okkāka’s line, a Sakyan’s son, a Light-Maker.
He is a Sambuddha, brahmin, in everything he is perfect,
having attained all deep knowledges and strengths, endowed with Vision regarding all things,
he has come to the end of all actions, in the end of all clinging he is freed.
He is the Buddha in the world, the Fortunate One, the Visionary who teaches Teaching,
after going there you can ask him about it, he will explain it to you.”
Having heard the word ‘Sambuddha’, Bāvari became elated,
then his grief became but little, and he received great happiness.
Bāvari, uplifted and elated,
enthusiastically asked that God:
“In which village, or again in which town,
in which country, is the lord of the world?
Where having gone to can we revere the Sambuddha, the Supreme Human Being?”
“The Victor is in the Kosalan’s city, Sāvatthī,
he has much wisdom, excellent and great intelligence,
that Sakyan’s son, who is free from burden and pollutant,
that Bull of a Man has understanding of head-splitting.”
So then the brahmin addressed his students, who were perfect in the the Vedas:
“Come, young men, and I shall explain, please listen to this word of mine:
He whose manifestation in the world is always exceptional,
has now arisen in the world, renowned as one called a ‘Sambuddha’.
Having gone quickly to Sāvatthī, you can see the Supreme Human Being.”
“Having seen him how will we know that he is the ‘Buddha’, O brahmin?
You must tell us who do not know, how we can know it is him.”
“There has come down to us in the the Vedas the marks of a Great Man,
they are explained as thirty-two, complete in regular order.
For whoever has on his limbs the marks of a Great Man,
there can be just two destinies, for a third cannot be found:
If he lives in a house, when he has been victorious over this earth,
without a stick or a sword he will rule according to the Teaching.
But if he goes forth from the house to the houseless life,
he becomes a Cover-Remover, a Sambuddha, a Worthy One, unexcelled.
About my birth, family, and marks; lore, students and other things,
about the head and head-splitting, you must ask in your mind.
If he should be a Buddha, one who sees without obstruction,
the questions that are asked in your mind he will answer by way of speech.”
After hearing Bāvari’s words, the sixteen brahmin students:
Ajita, Tissa Metteyya, Puṇṇaka, also Mettagū,
Dhotaka, and Upasīva, Nanda, and also Hemaka,
the two: Todeyya and Kappa, and Jatukaṇṇī, the one who is wise,
Bhadrāvudha and Udaya, and also the brahmin Posāla,
Mogharāja, the intelligent one, and the great seer, Piṅgiya,
each one with his own group,
meditators delighting in meditation,
after worshipping Bāvari, and circumambulating him,
they all, wearing matted-hair and deer-skins,
From Mūḷaka to Patiṭṭhāna first, then on to Mahissati,
to Ujjenī, and Gonaddha, to Vedisa, and to the place called Vanasa,
to Kosambī, and Sāketa, and Sāvatthī, the city supreme,
to Setabya, and Kapilavatthu, and to the city of Kusinārā,
to Pāvā, to Bhoganagara, to Vesālī, and to the Magadhan city (Rājagaha),
and to the Pāsāṇaka shrine,
Just like a thirsty man to cool water, or like a trader to great gain,
like one scorched by the heat to shade, quickly he climbed the mountain.
Now at that time the Fortunate One was in front of the community of monks,
teaching the Teaching to the monks, roaring like a lion in a forest,
Ajita saw the Sambuddha, brilliant like the hundred-rayed sun,
like the moon which has reached fullness on the fifteenth day of the month,
and after seeing on his limbs the characteristics in their fullness,
standing cheerfully on one side he asked a question in his mind:
“Speak and point out his birth, speak of his family, and marks,
speak of his perfection in the Vedas, how many does the brahmin school?”
“One hundred and twenty years his age, his family is Bāvari,
three marks are on his limbs, he is perfect in the three Vedas.
In the marks, and the traditions, with the glossaries, and the ritual,
he schools five hundred, in his own teaching he is perfect.”
“(Your) investigation of Bāvari’s marks, O One Supreme among Men,
O craving-cutter, make that clear, so that we are not left doubting.”
“He can cover his face with his tongue, there is hair between his eyebrows,
what is covered by a cloth is ensheathed: know it is so young man.”
Not hearing any question, but having heard the questions answered,
all the people were enthusiastic, and raised their hands, thinking:
“Now who was it, a God, or a Brahma, or Inda, the lord of Sujā,
who asked those questions with the mind? To whom did he make reply?
“About the head and head-splitting, Bāvari asks (this question),
please explain that O Fortunate One, please remove our doubts, O seer.”
“Know ignorance is called the head, and understanding is the head-splitter,
joined with confidence, mindfulness, concentration, desire, and energy.”
Then with great enthusiasm, being resolute, the young man,
having put his deer-skin on one shoulder, fell placing his head at (the Buddha’s) feet:
“The honourable brahmin Bāvari, and his students, dear Sir,
elated in heart, and happy in mind, worships your feet, O Visionary One.”
“May the brahmin Bāvari, together with his students, be happy!
And may you also be happy! May you live for a long time, young man!
All of the doubts that Bāvari, or you, or anyone else has,
having received leave, ask whatever you long (to know) in the mind.”
Having received leave from the Sambuddha, sitting with hands raised in reverence,
Ajita asked the Realised One the first question in that place:
“Having heard of a hero who has no desire for sense pleasures, said venerable Jatukaṇṇī,
I came to ask that desireless one who is beyond the flood,
please speak of the state of peace, conascent-eye,
as it really is, Fortunate One, please tell me this.
the Fortunate One moves about having vanquished sense desires,
as the splendid sun (vanquishes) the earth with its splendour.
To me of little wisdom, O One of Great Wisdom,
explain the Teaching so that I may know
the complete giving up of birth and old age here.”
“Remove the greed for sense pleasures, Jatukaṇṇī, said the Fortunate One,
let there be nothing found in you that has been taken up or put down.
You should erase that which is past, and have nothing for the future,
if you take up nothing in the present you will live peacefully.
For one altogether without greed for mind and body, O brahmin,
no pollutants are found whereby he can come under Death’s control.”
What are wholesome thoughts?
At whatever time a wholesome mind has arisen in the sensual realm,
connected with happiness, associated with knowledge,
(having) a form object, or a sound object,
or a tangible object, or a thought object,
or referring to whatever (thought),
at that time with ignorance as condition there is a (volitional) process,
with a (volitional) process as condition: consciousness,
with consciousness as condition: mind,
with mind as condition: the sixth sense sphere,
with the sixth sense sphere as condition: contact,
with contact as condition: feeling,
with feeling as condition: faith,
with faith as condition: resolve,
with resolve as condition: continuation,
with continuation as condition: birth,
with birth as condition: ageing, death,
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering.
Herein, what is ‘with ignorance as condition there is a (volitional) process?’
this is said to be ‘with ignorance as condition there is a (volitional) process.’
Herein, what is ‘with a (volitional) process as condition: consciousness?’

The nuns’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on training
The sub-chapter on evenly all around
The training rule on evenly all around
Venerables, these rules to be trained in come up for recitation.
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nuns from the group of six wore their sarongs hanging down in front and behind.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns wear their sarongs hanging down in front and behind? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The nuns heard the complaints of those people,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns from the group of six wear their sarongs hanging down in front and behind?” …
“Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can the nuns from the group of six do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘“I will wear my sarong evenly all around,” this is how you should train.’
One should wear one’s sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees.
If a nun, out of disrespect, wears her sarong hanging down in front or behind, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if she does not know;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.

The sub-chapter on shoes
the training rule on defecating in water
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nuns from the group of six were defecating, urinating, and spitting in water.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns defecate, urinate, and spit in water? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The nuns heard the complaints of those people,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns from the group of six defecate, urinate, and spit in water?”
The nuns told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered
and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can the nuns from the group of six do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘“I will not defecate, urinate, or spit in water,” this is how you should train.’
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
Soon afterwards, being afraid of wrongdoing, sick nuns did not defecate, urinate, or spit in water.
They told the Buddha. He then had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick nun to defecate, urinate, and spit in water.
And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘“When not sick, I will not defecate, urinate, or spit in water,” this is how you should train.’
If one is not sick, one should not defecate, urinate, or spit in water.
If, out of disrespect, a nun who is not sick defecates, urinates, or spits in water, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if she does not know;
if she does it on dry ground, but it then spreads to water;
if she is insane;
if she is deranged;
if she is overwhelmed by pain;
if she is the first offender.
The fifteenth training rule is finished.
The seventh sub-chapter on shoes is finished.

In regard to this I ask you,
‘Are you pure in this?’
A second time I ask,

You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”

The chapter on relinquishment
The training rule on exchanging what belongs to a group
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns staying at the precincts belonging to a certain association were weak because of a lack of rice porridge.
Then, after collecting voluntary contributions to supply the nuns with rice porridge, that association stored the ingredients in a shop. They then went to the nuns and said,
“Venerables, rice porridge ingredients are stored in such-and-such a shop. Please have someone get rice from that, have rice porridge cooked, and then eat it.”
But the nuns exchanged those ingredients for tonics, which they then used.
When that association found out about this, they complained and criticized them,
“When collective ingredients are designated for a specific purpose, how could the nuns exchange them for something else?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nuns did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… When collective ingredients are designated for a specific purpose, how could the nuns exchange them for something else?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘When a collective requisite is designated for a specific purpose, if a nun exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
A requisite is designated for a specific purpose:
it was given for a specific purpose.
Collective:
belonging to a group, not to the Sangha, not to an individual nun.
Exchanges it for something else:
if, apart from the purpose for which it was given, she exchanges it for something else, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When she obtains it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
It is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.
“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this thing, which I got in exchange for a collective requisite that was designated for a specific purpose, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this back to you.’”
If it is for a specific purpose and she perceives that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is for a specific purpose, but she does not perceive that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
When she receives in return what had been relinquished, it is to be used in accordance with the intention of the donors.
If it is not for a specific purpose, but she perceives that it is, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not for a specific purpose, and she does not perceive that it is, there is no offense.
if she makes use of the remainder;
if she makes use of it after getting permission from the owners;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.
The eighth training rule is finished.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the lay followers collected voluntary contributions to supply the Sangha of nuns with robes. They stored the requisites in a cloth merchant’s shop, and then went to the nuns and said,
“Venerables, requisites to be used for robes are stored in such-and-such a cloth merchant’s shop. Please have someone get cloth from that and share it out.”
But even though they had asked for them, the nuns exchanged those requisites for tonics, which they then used.

The training rule on exchanging what belongs to an individual
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Thullanandā was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings.
Many people visited her.
Just then the precincts of Thullanandā’s dwelling were falling apart.
People asked her why,
and she replied, “I have neither a donor, nor a worker.”
Then, after collecting voluntary contributions for the precincts of Thullanandā’s dwelling, the people gave the collected requisites to Thullanandā.
But even though she had asked for them, Thullanandā exchanged those requisites for tonics, which she then used.
When the people found out about this, they complained and criticized her,
“When personal requisites are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nun Thullanandā exchange them for something else?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”

The training rule on heavy cloaks
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Thullanandā was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings.
On one occasion when the weather was cold, king Pasenadi of Kosala dressed in an expensive woolen cloak and went to Thullanandā. He bowed and sat down.
And Thullanandā instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
He then said,
“Venerable, please say what you need.”
“Great king, if you wish to give me something, then give me this woolen cloak.”
The king gave her his cloak. He then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated her with his right side toward her, and left.
People complained and criticized her,
“These nuns have great desires; they are not content.
How can they ask the king for his woolen cloak?”
The nuns heard the complaints of those people,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā ask the king for his woolen cloak?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā asked for this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā ask the king for his woolen cloak?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun carries out an exchange to get a heavy cloak, it is to be worth at most four _kaṁsa_ coins.
If she gets one in exchange that is worth more than that, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
A heavy cloak:
whatever cloak is used in cold weather.
Carries out an exchange to get:
It is to be worth at most four _kaṁsa_ coins:
it may be worth sixteen _kahāpaṇa_ coins.
If she gets one in exchange that is worth more than that:
if she asks for one worth more than that, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When she obtains it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
It is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.
“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this heavy cloak worth more than four _kaṁsa_ coins, which I got in exchange, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this back to you.’”
If it is worth more than four _kaṁsa_ coins, and she perceives it as such, and she gets it in exchange, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is worth more than four _kaṁsa_ coins, but she is unsure of it, and she gets it in exchange, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is worth more than four _kaṁsa_ coins, but she perceives it as worth less, and she gets it in exchange, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is worth less than four _kaṁsa_ coins, but she perceives it as worth more, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is worth less than four _kaṁsa_ coins, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is worth less than four _kaṁsa_ coins, and she perceives it as such, there is no offense.
if she carries out an exchange for one worth at most four _kaṁsa_ coins;
if she carries out an exchange for one worth less than four _kaṁsa_ coins;
if it is from those who have given an invitation;
if it is for the benefit of someone else;
if it is by means of her own property;
if she gets one in exchange that has little value from someone who wants to exchange one of great value;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.

At that time the nun Thullanandā was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings.
On one occasion when the weather was warm, king Pasenadi of Kosala dressed in an expensive linen cloak and went to Thullanandā. He bowed and sat down.
And Thullanandā instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
He then said,
“Venerable, please say what you need.”

And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun carries out an exchange to get a light cloak, it is to be worth at most two-and-a-half _kaṁsa_ coins.
If she gets one in exchange that is worth more than that, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
A light cloak:
whatever cloak is used in warm weather.
Carries out an exchange to get:
It is to be worth at most two-and-a-half _kaṁsa_ coins:
it may be worth ten _kahāpaṇa_ coins.
If she gets one in exchange that is worth more than that:
if she asks for one worth more than that, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When she obtains it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.

In regard to this I ask you,
‘Are you pure in this?’
A second time I ask,

The second training rule on exchanging what belongs to a group
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns staying at the precincts belonging to a certain association were weak because of a lack of rice porridge.
Then, after collecting voluntary contributions to supply the nuns with rice porridge, that association stored the ingredients in a shop. They then went to the nuns and said,
“Venerables, rice porridge ingredients are stored in such-and-such a shop.
Please have someone get rice from that, have rice porridge cooked, and then eat it.”
But even though they had asked for them, the nuns exchanged those ingredients for tonics, which they then used.
When that association found out about this, they complained and criticized them,
“When collective ingredients are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nuns exchange them for something else?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nuns did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… When collective ingredients are designated for a specific purpose and were asked for, how could the nuns exchange them for something else?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘When a collective requisite is designated for a specific purpose and was asked for, if a nun exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
A requisite is designated for a specific purpose:
it was given for a specific purpose.
Collective:
belonging to a group, not to the Sangha, not to an individual nun.
Was asked for:
that she herself had asked for.
Exchanges it for something else:
if, apart from the purpose for which it was given, she exchanges it for something else, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When she obtains it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
It is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.
“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this.
‘Venerables, this thing, which I got in exchange for a collective requisite that was designated for a specific purpose and had been asked for, is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this back to you.’”
If it is for a specific purpose and she perceives that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is for a specific purpose, but she is unsure of it, and she exchange it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is for a specific purpose, but she does not perceive that it is, and she exchanges it for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.

At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nun Thullanandā was sick.
A lay follower approached her and asked,
“I hope you’re bearing up, Venerable, I hope you’re getting better?”
“I’m not bearing up, and I’m not getting better.”
“We’ll deposit a _kahāpaṇa_ coin in such-and-such a shop. Please get whatever you wish from there.”
Thullanandā then said to a trainee nun,
“Go to such-and-such a shop and bring back a _kahāpaṇa_’s worth of oil.”
That trainee nun did just that and gave it to Thullanandā.
Thullanandā said,
“I don’t need oil; I need ghee.”
The trainee nun returned to the shopkeeper and said,
“It seems the nun doesn’t need oil, but ghee. Here’s your oil; please give me ghee.”
“Venerable, if we were to take back goods that have been sold, when would our goods be sold?
When oil is bought, oil is taken away. Buying ghee, you receive that, and you’ll take that away.”
The trainee nun started to cry.
The nuns asked her
and she told them what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā get one thing in exchange and then something else?” …

The training rule on swapping robes
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Thullanandā was using a robe she had received after swapping with another nun.
But the other nun folded up the robe she had received and put it aside.
Thullanandā then said to her,
“Venerable, where’s that robe that I swapped with you?”
She brought out the robe and showed it to her,
and Thullanandā said,
“Here’s your robe and give me that robe of mine. That which is yours is yours and that which is mine is mine. Give me that and take back what’s yours.” And she just took it.
That nun then told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā swap a robe with a nun and then take it back?”
Those nuns then told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”

The training rule on collections of almsbowls
Venerables, these thirty rules on relinquishment and confession come up for recitation.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns from the group of six had collected a large number of almsbowls.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized those nuns,
“How can the nuns collect a large number of bowls? Will they start up as bowl merchants or set up a bowl shop?”
The nuns heard the complaints of those people,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized those nuns,
“How can the nuns from the group of six collect bowls?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nuns from the group of six do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can the nuns from the group of six collect bowls?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun collects almsbowls, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
there are two kinds of bowl: the iron bowl and the ceramic bowl.
And there are three grades of bowl: the large bowl, the medium bowl, and the small bowl.
The large bowl:
it takes half an _āḷhaka_ measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of non-staple food, and a suitable amount of curry.
The medium bowl:
it takes a _nāḷika_ measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of non-staple food, and a suitable amount of curry.
The small bowl:
it takes a _pattha_ measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of non-staple food, and a suitable amount of curry.
Anything larger than this is not a bowl, nor anything smaller.
almsbowls that have neither been determined nor transferred to another.
Entailing relinquishment:
entailing relinquishment at dawn.
The bowl is to be relinquished to the Sangha, a group, or an individual nun.
“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this.
After approaching the Sangha, that nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I have kept for more than one day, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’
After relinquishing it, she is to confess the offense.
The confession should be received by a competent and capable nun.
The relinquished bowl is then to be given back:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This almsbowl, which was to be relinquished by the nun so-and-so, has been relinquished to the Sangha.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this bowl back to nun so-and-so.’
After approaching several nuns, that nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I have kept for more than one day, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the venerables.’
After relinquishing it, she is to confess the offense.
The confession should be received by a competent and capable nun.
The relinquished bowl is then to be given back:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
This almsbowl, which was to be relinquished by the nun so-and-so, has been relinquished to you.
If it seems appropriate to you, you should give this bowl back to nun so-and-so.’
After approaching a single nun, that nun should put her upper robe over one shoulder, squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘This almsbowl, which I have kept for more than one day, is to be relinquished.
I relinquish it to you.’
After relinquishing it, she is to confess the offense.
The confession should be received by that nun.
The relinquished bowl is then to be given back:
‘I give this almsbowl back to you.’”
If it is more than one day and she perceives it as more, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than one day, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is more than one day, but she perceives it as less, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been determined, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been transferred, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it has not been given away, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.

If it has not been destroyed, but she perceives that it has …
If it is not broken, but she perceives that it is …
If it has not been stolen, but she perceives that it has, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If she uses an almsbowl which is to be relinquished without first relinquishing it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than one day, but she perceives it as more, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than one day, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is less than one day and she perceives it as less, there is no offense.
if, before dawn, it is determined, transferred to another, given away, lost, destroyed, broken, stolen, or taken on trust;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.
Soon afterwards the nuns from the group six did not give back a relinquished bowl.
They told the Buddha.
“Monks, a relinquished almsbowl is to be given back.
If a nun doesn’t give it back, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”

The training rule on the sharing out of out-of-season robe-cloth
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time, after completing the rainy-season residence in a village monastery, a number of nuns were traveling to Sāvatthī. They were perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes.
Some lay followers who saw them thought,
“These nuns are perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes; they must’ve been robbed,” and they gave out-of-season robe-cloth to the Sangha of nuns.
Because they had done the robe-making procedure, the nun Thullanandā
determined it as in-season robe-cloth, and then shared it out.
The lay followers asked those nuns whether
they had obtained any robe-cloth.
They replied that they hadn’t
and told them what had happened.
Those lay followers then complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā determine out-of-season robe-cloth as ‘in-season’, and then share it out?”
The nuns heard the complaints of those lay followers,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā do this?”
Those nuns then told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun determines out-of-season robe-cloth as “in-season”, and then shares it out, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
Out-of-season robe-cloth:
if the robe-making procedure has not been done, robe-cloth that is given during the eleven months. If the robe-making procedure has been done, robe-cloth that is given during the seven months. Also, if it is given in the robe season, but the cloth is designated, it is called “out-of-season robe-cloth”.
If she shares it out, after determining out-of-season robe-cloth as “in-season”, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When the robe-cloth is obtained, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
The robe-cloth is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.
“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this.
… ‘Venerables, this out-of-season robe-cloth which I shared out after determining it as “in-season” is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …

you should give …
‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’”
If it is out-of-season robe-cloth and she perceives it as such, and she shares it out after determining it as “in-season”, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is out-of-season robe-cloth, but she is unsure of it, and she shares it out after determining it as “in-season”, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is out-of-season robe-cloth, but she perceives it as in-season robe-cloth, and she shares it out after determining it as “in-season”, there is no offense.
If it is in-season robe-cloth, but she perceives it as out-of-season robe-cloth, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is in-season robe-cloth, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is in-season robe-cloth and she perceives it as such, there is no offense.

At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nun Thullanandā was sick.
A lay follower approached her and asked,
“Venerable, what’s wrong with you? What may I get you?”
“I need ghee.”
That lay follower then brought back from a shop a _kahāpaṇa_’s worth of ghee and gave it to Thullanandā.
Thullanandā said,
“I don’t need ghee;
I need oil.”
The lay follower returned to the shopkeeper and said,
“It seems the nun doesn’t need ghee, but oil.
Here’s your ghee; please give me oil.”
“Sir, if we were to take back goods that have been sold, when would our goods be sold?
When ghee is bought, ghee is taken away. Buying oil, you receive that, and you’ll take that away.”
That lay follower then complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā ask for one thing and then for something else?”
The nuns heard the complaints of that lay follower,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her …
Those nuns then told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā ask for one thing and then for something else?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun asks for one thing and then for something else, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
Asks for one thing:
whatever she asks for.
Then for something else:
apart from that thing, if she asks for something else, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When she obtains it, it becomes subject to relinquishment.
It is to be relinquished to the Sangha of nuns, a group, or an individual nun.
“And, monks, it’s to be relinquished like this.
… ‘Venerables, this thing, which I asked for after asking for something else, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ …
the Sangha should give …
you should give …
‘I give this back to you.’”
If it is something else and she perceives it as such, and she asks for that, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is something else, but she is unsure of it, and she asks for that, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is something else, but she does not perceives it as such, and she asks for that, she commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.
If it is not something else, but she perceives it as such, and she asks for that, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not something else, but she is unsure of it, and she asks for that, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not something else, and she does not perceives it as such, and she asks for that, there is no offense.
if she asks for both at the same time;
if she demonstrates a benefit and then asks;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.
The fourth training rule is finished.

The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion
The training rule on those who conceal offenses
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Sundarīnandā was pregnant by Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha.
When the fetus got large, she concealed her condition.
And when the fetus was fully grown, she disrobed and gave birth.
The nuns said to the nun Thullanandā,
“Venerable, Sundarīnandā gave birth shortly after disrobing.”
“Could it be that she was pregnant while she was still a nun?”
“Yes, Venerables.”
“But, Venerable, when you knew that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, why didn’t you either confront her yourself or tell a group of nuns?”
“Her disrepute is my disrepute, her infamy is my infamy, her notoriety is my notoriety, her loss is my loss.
Why would I tell others of my own disrepute, infamy, notoriety, and loss?”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā, knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell a group of nuns?”
Then those nuns told the monks what had happened,
and the monks in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell a group of nuns?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but she neither confronts her herself nor tells a group of nuns, and afterward—whether that nun remains or has died or has been expelled or has converted—she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was like this, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself nor tell a group of nuns,’” she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on those who conceal offenses.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
she knows by herself or others have told her or she has told her.
Has committed an offense entailing expulsion:
she has committed any one of the eight offenses entailing expulsion.
She neither confronts her herself:
she does not herself accuse her.
Nor tells a group of nuns:
she does not tell other nuns.
Whether that nun remains or has died:
Remains: what is meant is that she remains as a nun.
Has died: what is meant is that she has passed away.
Has been expelled:
she has either disrobed herself or been expelled by others.
Has converted:
what is meant is that she has joined another religious community.
Afterward she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was like this, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself’”:
“I won’t accuse her myself.”
“Nor tell a group of nuns”:
“Nor tell other nuns.”
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion.
Is expelled:
just as a fallen, withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again, so a nun who knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but who thinks, “I will neither confront her myself nor tell a group of nuns,” by the mere fact of giving up her duty, is not an ascetic, not a daughter of the Sakyan.
Therefore it is said “she is expelled”.
Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”.
She does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”.
if she does not tell because she thinks there will be quarrels or disputes in the Sangha;
if she does not tell because she thinks there will be a schism or fracture in the Sangha;
if she does not tell because she thinks the person she is telling about is cruel and harsh and that she might become a danger to life or to the living of the spiritual life;
if she does not tell because she does not see any suitable nuns;
if she does not tell, but not because she wants to conceal;
if she does not tell because she thinks the other person will be known through her own actions;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.
The sixth offense entailing expulsion is finished.

The training rule on taking sides with one who has been ejected
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nun Thullanandā was taking sides with the monk Ariṭṭha, formerly a vulture-killer, who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can Venerable Thullanandā take sides with the monk Ariṭṭha who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā is doing this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can the nun Thullanandā take sides with the monk Ariṭṭha who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun takes sides with a monk who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha—in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—and who is disrespectful, who has not made amends, and who has not made friends, the nuns should correct her like this:
“Venerable, this monk has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. He’s disrespectful, hasn’t made amends, and hasn’t made friends. Venerable, don’t take sides with this monk.”
If that nun continues as before, the nuns should press her up to three times to make her stop.
If she then stops, all is well.
If she does not stop, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on taking sides with one who has been ejected.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
A unanimous Sangha:
those belonging to the same Buddhist sect and staying within the same monastic boundary.
Who has been ejected:
who has been ejected for not recognizing an offense, for not making amends, or for not giving up a bad view.
in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law:
in accordance with that rule, in accordance with that Monastic Law.
In accordance with the Teacher’s instruction:
in accordance with the Conqueror’s instruction, in accordance with the Buddha’s instruction.
Who is disrespectful:
he does not heed the Sangha, groups of monks, individual monks, or legal procedures.
Who has not made amends:
he has been ejected and not reinstated.
Who has not made friends:
monks belonging to the same Buddhist sect is what is meant by “friends”.
He is not together with them—therefore it is called “who has not made friends”.
Takes sides with:
she has the same view, the same belief, the same persuasion as he does.
that nun who supports one who has been ejected.
Other nuns who see it or hear about it.
They should correct her like this:
“Venerable, this monk has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. He’s disrespectful, hasn’t made amends, and hasn’t made friends.
Venerable, don’t take sides with this monk.”
And they should correct her a second
and a third time.
If she stops, all is well.
If she does not stop, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If those who heard about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
That nun, even if she has to be pulled into the middle of the Sangha, should be corrected like this:
“Venerable, this monk has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. He’s disrespectful, hasn’t made amends, and hasn’t made friends.
Venerable, don’t take sides with this monk.”
They should correct her a second
and a third time.
If she stops, all is well.
If she does not stop, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Should press her:
“And, monks, she should be pressed like this.
A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The nun so-and-so is taking sides with a monk who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha—in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—and who is disrespectful, who has not made amends, and who has not made friends. And she keeps on doing it.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press her to make her stop.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The nun so-and-so is taking sides with a monk who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha—in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—and who is disrespectful, who has not made amends, and who has not made friends.
And she keeps on doing it.
The Sangha presses her to make her stop.
Any nun who approves of pressing her to make her stop should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter …
For the third time I speak on this matter …
The Sangha has pressed nun so-and-so to stop.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, she commits a serious offense.
When the last announcement is finished, she commits an offense entailing expulsion.
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion.
Is expelled:
just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put together again, so a nun who does not stop when pressed three times is not an ascetic, not a daughter of the Sakyan.
Therefore it is said “she is expelled”.
Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”.
She does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, but she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing expulsion.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, and she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing expulsion.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as illegitimate, and she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing expulsion.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as legitimate, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if she has not been pressed;
if she stops;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.
The seventh offense entailing expulsion is finished.

The training rule having eight parts
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns from the group of six, being lustful and aiming to indulge in inappropriate sexual conduct, consented to lustful men holding their hand and the edge of their robes, and they stood with them, chatted with them, went to appointments with them, consented to men coming to them, entered covered places with them, and disposed their body for that purpose.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns from the group of six do such things?” …
“Is it true, monks, that those nuns do these things?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can the nuns from the group of six, being lustful and aiming to indulge in inappropriate sexual conduct, consent to lustful men holding their hand and the edge of their robes, and how can they stand with them, chat with them, go to appointments with them, consent to men coming to them, enter covered places with them, and dispose their body for that purpose?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If, for the purpose of indulging in inappropriate sexual conduct, a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding her hand and the edge of her robe, and she stands with him and chats with him and goes to an appointment with him and consents to him coming to her and enters a covered place with him and disposes her body for him for that purpose, she too is expelled and excluded from the community.

If, for the purpose of indulging in inappropriate sexual conduct, she consents to him holding her above the collar bone or below the knees, she commits a serious offense.
And the edge of her robe:
if, for the purpose of indulging in inappropriate sexual conduct, she consents to him holding her sarong or upper robe, she commits a serious offense.

And goes to an appointment with him:
if, for the purpose of indulging in inappropriate sexual conduct, she goes to such-and-such a place when told by a man to do so, then for every step, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion.

“Venerables, the eight rules on expulsion have been recited.
If a nun commits any one of them, she no longer belongs to the community of nuns. As before, so after, she is expelled and excluded from the community.
In regard to this I ask you,

You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”

Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha wanted to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns.
He went to the nuns and said,
“Venerables, I wish to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns.
Please give me the nun in charge of building work.”
At that time four sisters had gone forth as nuns:
Nandā, Nandavatī, Sundarīnandā, and Thullanandā.
Of these, the nun Sundarīnandā had gone forth when she was young, and she was beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent, and she possessed good judgment in regard to doing and arranging things well.
After appointing Sundarīnandā to be in charge of building work, the Sangha made her work with Sāḷha.
As a consequence of this, Sundarīnandā would often go to Sāḷha’s house to ask for tools,
whether an adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel.
And Sāḷha would often go to the nuns’ dwelling place to find out about the progress of the building work.
And because they saw each other frequently, they fell in love.
But because Sāḷha could not find any opportunity to be intimate with Sundarīnandā, he invited the Sangha of nuns for a meal.
When preparing the seats in the dining hall, he counted the number of nuns senior to Venerable Sundarīnandā and placed their seats to one side, and he counted the number of nuns junior to her and placed their seat on the other side.
He then placed Sundarīnandā’s seat in a concealed spot in a corner. In this way the senior nuns would think she was seated close to the junior ones and the junior nuns would think she was seated close to the senior ones.
Soon afterwards he informed the Sangha that the meal was ready.
Sundarīnandā thought, “Sāḷha hasn’t prepared a meal for the Sangha as a service, but because he wants to be intimate with me.
If I go, I will get into trouble.” She then told a nun who was her pupil, “Go and bring back almsfood for me.
If anyone asks about me, tell them I’m sick.”
“Yes, Venerable,” she replied.
Soon afterwards Sāḷha was standing outside the gateway of his house repeatedly inquiring after Sundarīnandā:
“Venerables, where’s Venerable Sundarīnandā?”
The nun who was Sundarīnandā’s pupil told him: “She’s sick. I’m bringing her almsfood.”
Sāḷha thought, “I invited the Sangha of nuns because of Sundarīnandā,”
and after telling the people there to serve the meal to the Sangha of nuns, he left for the nuns’ dwelling place.
Just then Sundarīnandā was standing outside the monastery gateway longing for Sāḷha.
When she saw him coming, she entered the dwelling, put on her upper robe so that it covered her head, and lay down on her bed.
Sāḷha approached her and said, “Venerable, what’s wrong with you? Why are you lying down?”
“That’s what happens when you desire someone who doesn’t desire you in return.”
“What do you mean I don’t desire you?
I just couldn’t find an opportunity to be intimate with you.”
And both having lust, he made physical contact with Sundarīnandā.
Just then a nun who was weak from old age and had problems with her feet was lying down not far from Sundarīnandā.
She saw how Sāḷha made physical contact with Sundarīnandā while both of them had lust.
She complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?”
That nun then told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?”
Those nuns then told the monks.
And the monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, criticized her in the same way.
After criticizing the nun Sundarīnandā in many ways, they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for the nun Sundarīnandā, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How could Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it,
but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”
And the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons:
for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad nuns, for the ease of good nuns, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on above the knees.’”
whoever, of such a kind, of such activity, of such social standing, of such name, of such family, of such conduct, of such behavior, of such association, who is senior, who is junior, or who is of middle standing—this is called “a”.
she is a nun because she lives on alms;
a nun because she has gone over to living on alms;
a nun because she wears a patchwork cloth;
a nun by convention;
a nun on account of her claim;
a “come, nun” nun;
a nun given the full ordination by going to the three refuges;
a good nun;
a nun of substance;
a trainee nun;
a fully trained nun;
a nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand.
The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.

Therefore it is said “she is expelled”.
Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”.
She does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”.
If both have lust and either of them makes physical contact, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits an offense entailing expulsion.

The training rule on receiving food
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time there was a beautiful nun called Sundarīnandā.
When people saw her in the dining hall, they gave her the best food, both the donors and the recipient having lust.
Sundarīnandā ate as much as she liked,
but not so the other nuns.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Sundarīnandā, being lustful, eat either staple or non-staple food after receiving it directly from a lustful man?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could Sundarīnandā, being lustful, eat either staple or non-staple food after receiving it directly from a lustful man?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a lustful nun eats staple or non-staple food after receiving it directly from a lustful man, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”

Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
If she receives staple or non-staple food with the intention of eating it, she commits a serious offense.
For every mouthful, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses.
An immediate offense:
there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required.

The second training rule on receiving food
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time there was a beautiful nun called Sundarīnandā.
When people saw her in the dining hall, they were affected by lust, and they gave her the best food.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, Sundarīnandā did not receive it.
The nun next to her said,
“Why didn’t you receive it, Venerable?”
“Because they have lust.”
“But do you have lust?”
“What can this man do to you, whether he has lust or not, when you’re without it?
Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands, and eat whatever staple or non-staple food he gives you.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun say,
‘What can this man do to you, whether he has lust or not, when you’re without it?
Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands, and eat whatever staple or non-staple food he gives you’?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun said this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can a nun say,
‘What can this man do to you, whether he has lust or not, when you’re without it?
Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands, and eat whatever staple or non-staple food he gives you’?

Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands and then eat whatever staple or non-staple food he gives you,” then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
if she urges her on, saying, “Venerable, what can this man do to you, whether he has lust or not, if you’re without? Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands and then eat whatever staple or non-staple food he gives you,” then she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If, because of her statement, the other nun receives staple or non-staple food with the intention of eating it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, she commits a serious offense.
At the end of the meal, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses.
An immediate offense:
there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required.
Entailing sending away:

Suspension:

The training rule on renouncing the training
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nun Caṇḍakāḷī had argued with the nuns. In anger she said this:
“I renounce the Buddha, I renounce the Teaching, I renounce the Sangha, I renounce the training!
The Sakyan daughters are not the only ascetics. There are other ascetics who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. I’ll practice the spiritual life with them.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could the nun Caṇḍakāḷī say this in anger?
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakāḷī said this in anger?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Caṇḍakāḷī say this in anger?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …

then the nuns should correct her like this:
“Venerable, don’t say such things in anger, ‘I renounce the Buddha, I renounce the Teaching, I renounce the Sangha, I renounce the training! The Sakyan daughters are not the only ascetics.
There are other ascetics who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
I’ll practice the spiritual life with them.’ Take delight, Venerable; the Teaching is well proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”

The second training rule on bad behavior
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Thullanandā had been pressed by the Sangha. She then said to the nuns,
“But, Venerables, you should socialize.
Don’t live separately.
There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety,  and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses.

The nuns’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension
The training rule on being litigious
Venerables, these seventeen rules on suspension come up for recitation.
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
At that time a lay follower who had given a storehouse to the Sangha of nuns had died.
He had two sons,
one with and one without faith and confidence,
and they divided their father’s property between them.
Then the one without faith said to the other,
“The storehouse is ours; let’s share it out.”
But the one with faith responded,
our father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.”
A second time they both said the same thing,
and a third time the one without faith repeated his proposal.
The one with faith then thought,
“If I get it, I too would give it to the Sangha of nuns,”
and he said,
“Let’s share it out.”
But when they shared out that storehouse, it fell to the one without faith.
He then went to the nuns and said,
“Please depart, Venerables, this storehouse is mine.”
The nun Thullanandā said to him,
“No, your father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.”
Because they were unable to agree, they asked judges to decide on the matter.
They said,
“Venerable, who knows that it was given to the Sangha of nuns?”
Thullanandā replied,
“But Sirs, didn’t you appoint a witness who saw or heard the giving of the gift?”
“It’s true what the Venerable says,” the judges made the storehouse the property of the Sangha of nuns.
The defeated man complained and criticized the nuns,
“They’re not ascetics these shaven-headed sluts.
How can they take my storehouse?”
Thullanandā told the judges of this
and they punished him.
That man then made a dwelling place for Ājīvaka ascetics not far from the nuns,
inciting them to abuse the nuns.
Once again Thullanandā told the judges
and the judges jailed him.
People then complained and criticized those nuns,
“First the nuns take his storehouse, then they have him punished, and then they have him jailed.
Now they’ll have him executed!”
Nuns heard the complaints of those people,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā be litigious?”
Then those nuns told the monks …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā is litigious?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā be litigious?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun is litigious toward a householder or a householder’s child or a slave or a worker or even toward an ascetic or a wanderer, then that nun has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
Litigious:
what is meant is that she is the initiator of a lawsuit.
A householder:
whoever lives at home.
A householder’s child:
whoever is a child or a sibling.
one born in the household, one who has been bought, one who has been brought back as a captive.
a paid worker, a servant.
An ascetic or a wanderer:
anyone who is a wanderer apart from Buddhist monks, nuns, trainee nuns, novice monks, and novice nuns.
If, thinking, “I’ll initiate a lawsuit,” she looks for a companion or just goes there herself, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she tells one other person, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she tells a second person, she commits a serious offense.
At the end of the lawsuit, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
An immediate offense:
there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required.
Entailing sending away:
she is sent away from the Sangha.
Suspension:
only the Sangha gives the trial period for that offense, sends back to the beginning, and rehabilitates—not several nuns, not an individual nun.
Therefore it is called an offense entailing suspension.
This is the name and designation of this class of offense.
Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension.
if she goes there because people pull her;
if she is asking for protection;
if she tells without specifying a person;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns who were the pupils of the nun Thullanandā were socializing and behaving badly, had a bad reputation, and were harassing the Sangha of nuns and hiding each other’s offenses.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns behave in this way?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns are behaving like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”

The training rule on reinstating one who has been ejected
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Caṇḍakāḷī was quarrelsome and argumentative, and she created legal issues in the Sangha.
But when a legal procedure was being done against her, the nun Thullanandā objected.
Soon afterwards Thullanandā went to a village on some business.
The Sangha of nuns
took the opportunity to eject Caṇḍakāḷī for not recognizing an offense.
When Thullanandā had finished her business in that village, she returned to Sāvatthī.
On her return, Caṇḍakāḷī neither prepared a seat for her, nor set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, or water for washing the feet; and she did not go out to meet her to receive her bowl and robe, nor ask whether she wanted water to drink.
Thullanandā asked her
why she was acting like this.
She replied, “That’s how it is, Venerable, when you don’t have a protector.”
“But how is it, Venerable, that you don’t have a protector?”
“When the nuns knew
that no-one would speak up for me because I am not esteemed by them and I didn’t have a protector, they ejected me for not recognizing an offense.”
“They are incompetent fools. They don’t know about legal procedures or their flaws, nor what makes them fail or succeed.
But we know all these things.
We can get legal procedures done that haven’t been done, and we can get procedures that have been done overturned.” And she quickly gathered a sangha of nuns and reinstated the nun Caṇḍakāḷī.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā reinstate a nun who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, without first getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her:
“… How could the nun Thullanandā reinstate a nun who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, without first getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun, without getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group, reinstates a nun who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the rule and the Monastic Law and the Teacher’s instruction, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
A unanimous Sangha:
those belonging to the same Buddhist sect and staying within the same monastic boundary.
Who has been ejected:
who has been ejected for not recognizing an offense, for not making amends, or for not giving up a bad view.
In accordance with the rule and the Monastic Law:
in accordance with that rule, in accordance with that Monastic Law.
In accordance with the Teacher’s instruction:
in accordance with the Conqueror’s instruction, in accordance with the Buddha’s instruction.
Without getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure:
without having asked permission of the Sangha that did the legal procedure of ejection.
Without the consent of the group:
without being aware of any consent from the group.
If, intending to reinstate her, she searches for a group or establishes a monastic boundary, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. After each of the first two announcements, she commits a serious offense. When the last announcement is finished, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses.
An immediate offense:
there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required.
Entailing sending away:
she is sent away from the Sangha.
Suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, and she reinstates her, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, and she reinstates her, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as illegitimate, and she reinstates her, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as legitimate, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if she reinstates her after getting permission from the Sangha that did the procedure;
if she reinstates her with the consent of the group;
if she reinstates one who is behaving properly;
if she reinstates her when the Sangha that did the procedure is unavailable;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.

The training rule on one who gives the full admission to a criminal
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time in Vesālī the wife of a certain Licchavī man was unfaithful.
He said to her,
“Please stop. If you don’t, I’ll punish you.”
But she did not listen.
Just then in Vesālī the Licchavī clan had gathered on some business.
That Licchavī man said to them,
“Sirs, please give me permission in regard to one of my wives.”
“What is it with her?”
“She’s unfaithful. I wish to kill her.”
“You may go ahead.”
When his wife heard
that her husband wanted to kill her,
she took their most valuable possessions and went to Sāvatthī. There she approached ascetics of other religions and asked for the going forth,
but they refused.
She then went to the Buddhist nuns and again asked for the going forth,
but they too refused.
She then went to the nun Thullanandā, showed her the goods, and once again asked for the going forth.
Thullanandā took the goods and gave her the going forth.
That Licchavī man then went to Sāvatthī in search of his wife. When he saw that she had been given the going forth as a nun, he went to King Pasenadi of Kosala
“Sir, my wife took my most valuable possessions and came to Sāvatthī.
Please permit me to deal with her.”
“Well then, find her and then inform me.”
“I’ve seen her. She’s gone forth as a nun.”
“If she’s gone forth as a nun, there’s nothing that can be done.
The Teaching of the Buddha is well-proclaimed. Let her practice the spiritual life for the full ending of suffering.”
Then that Licchavī man complained and criticized the nuns,
“How can the nuns give the going forth to a criminal?”
The nuns heard the complaints of that Licchavī man,
and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā give the going forth to a criminal?”
The nuns told the monks. …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā give the going forth to a criminal?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun, without getting permission from the king or the Sangha or a community or an association or a society, gives the full admission to a woman who she knows is a criminal and who is known as sentenced to death, then, except when it is allowable, that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
She knows:
she knows by herself or others have told her or she has told her.
any woman who has stolen anything worth five _māsakas_ coins or more is called “a criminal”.
Sentenced to death:
she has been sentenced to death because of her action.
it is known to other people that she has been sentenced to death.
Without getting permission from:
where a king reigns, permission should be gotten from the king.
The Sangha:
what is meant is the Sangha of nuns, and permission should be gotten from that Sangha.
where a community governs, permission should be gotten from that community.
where an association governs, permission should be gotten from that association.
where a society governs, permission should be gotten from that society.
Except when it is allowable:
unless it is allowable.
Allowable:
there are two allowable situations: she has gone forth as an ascetic of another religion or she has gone forth as a Buddhist nun.
If, intending to give the full admission, she searches for a group, a teacher, a bowl, or a robe, or she establishes a monastic boundary, then, except when it is allowable, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, she commits a serious offense.
When the last announcement is finished, the preceptor commits an offense entailing suspension,
and the group and the teacher commit an offense of wrong conduct.
this is said with reference to the preceding offense.
An immediate offense:
there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required.
Entailing sending away:
she is sent away from the Sangha.
Suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension.
If she is a criminal, and the nun perceives her as such, and she gives her the full admission, except when it is allowable, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
If she is a criminal, but the nun is unsure of it, and she gives her the full admission, except when it is allowable, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is a criminal, but the nun does not perceive her as such, and she gives her the full admission, except when it is allowable, there is no offense.
If she is not a criminal, but the nun perceives her as such, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is not a criminal, but the nun is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If she is not a criminal, and the nun does not perceive her as such, there is no offense.
if she gives her the full admission without knowing that she is a criminal;
if she gives her the full admission after getting permission;
if she gives her the full admission when it is allowable;

The training rule on being angry about a legal issue
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Caṇḍakāḷī was angry that a legal issue had been decided against her, saying,
“The nuns are acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Caṇḍakāḷī say such things just because she is angry that a legal issue has been decided against her?”
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Caṇḍakāḷī said this because she was angry?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could Venerable Caṇḍakāḷī say such things just because she is angry that a legal issue has been decided against her?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun is angry because a legal issue has been decided against her, saying,
“The nuns are acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear,”
then the nuns should correct her like this:
“Venerable, just because you’re angry that a legal issue has been decided against you, don’t say,
‘The nuns are acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.’
Perhaps it’s you who are acting out of desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.”

The training rule on walking alone to the next village
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a nun who was a pupil of Bhaddā Kāpilānī had an argument with the nuns and then went to her relatives’ village.
Not seeing her pupil anywhere, Bhaddā Kāpilānī asked the nuns, “Where’s so-and-so? She’s disappeared.”
“She disappeared, Venerable, after arguing with the nuns.”
“My dears, her relatives live in such-and-such a village.
Go there and look for her.”
The nuns went there, and when they saw her, they said to her, “Why did you go alone, Venerable? We hope you weren’t assaulted?”
“I wasn’t.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun walk to the next village by herself?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can a nun walk to the next village by herself?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
On one occasion two nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī.
On the way they had to cross a river.
They approached a boatman and said, “Please take us across.”
“I’m not able, Venerables, to take both of you across at the same time.”
And so they crossed individually, alone with the boatman.
When he had crossed with the first nun, he raped her.
And after returning to the first bank, he raped the other nun as well.
Later, when they were reunited, they asked each other,
“Venerable, I hope you weren’t assaulted?”
And you, Venerable, were you assaulted?”
“I was, too.”
They then continued on to Sāvatthī and told the nuns there what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can a nun cross a river by herself?”
They told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can a nun cross a river by herself?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself or crosses a river by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
On one occasion a number of nuns were walking through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī, when one evening they arrived at a certain village.
One of the nuns was beautiful and graceful, and a certain man fell in love with her as soon as he saw her.
Then, as he was preparing sleeping places for those nuns, he prepared hers to one side.
And that nun thought, “This man is obsessed with me. If I go there for the night, I’ll get into trouble.”
Then, without taking leave of the nuns, she went to a certain family and slept there.
When night arrived, that man went searching for that nun, and as he did so he bumped into the other nuns.
Not seeing that nun anywhere, the nuns said, “No doubt she has left with a man.”
The following morning that nun returned to the nuns, and they said to her, “Venerable, why did you leave with a man?”
“I didn’t leave with a man, Venerables.”
She then told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun spend the night apart by herself?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can a nun spent the night apart by herself?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself or crosses a river by herself or spends the night apart by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns.
On one occasion a number of nuns were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī.
One of the nuns, needing to defecate, stayed behind by herself, and then followed behind the others.
People saw her and raped her.
She then went to the other nuns, and they said to her, “Why did you stay behind by yourself, Venerable? We hope you weren’t assaulted?”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun lag behind her companions by herself?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can a nun lag behind her companions by herself?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun walks to the next village by herself or crosses a river by herself or spends the night apart by herself or lags behind her companions by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
Walks to the next village by herself:
if she crosses the boundary of an enclosed village with her first foot, she commits a serious offense.
If she then crosses it with her second foot, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
If she enters the vicinity of an unenclosed village with her first foot, she commits a serious offense.
If she then enters it with her second foot, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
Or crosses a river by herself:
A river: wherever, after covering the three circles, the sarong gets wet when the nun is crossing.
When she has crossed with the first foot, she commits a serious offense.
When she has crossed with the second foot, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
Or spends the night apart by herself:
if, at dawn, she is in the process of going beyond arm’s reach of her companion nun, she commits a serious offense.
When she has gone beyond, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
Or lags behind her companions by herself:
if, in an uninhabited area, in the wilderness, she is in the process of going beyond the range of sight or the range of hearing of her companion nun, she commits a serious offense.
When she has gone beyond, she commits an offense entailing suspension.
this is said with reference to the preceding offenses.
An immediate offense:
there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required.
Entailing sending away:
she is sent away from the Sangha.
Suspension:
… Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension.
if her companion nun has left or disrobed or died or joined another faction;
if she is insane;
if she is the first offender.
The third offense entailing suspension is finished.

At that time a number of nuns were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī, when one evening they arrived at a certain village. There they approached a brahmin family and asked for a place to stay.
The brahmin woman told them,
“Please wait, Venerables, until my husband returns.”
While they were waiting, the nuns put out bedding, and some sat down on it while others lay down.
When the husband returned at night, he said to his wife,
“Who are they?”
“They are nuns.”
“Throw out these shaven-headed sluts!”, and he had them thrown out of the house.
Those nuns then went to Sāvatthī, where they told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns approach families at the wrong time, put out bedding without asking permission of the owners, and then sit down and lie down on it?” …

The training rule on cleaning with water
At one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery,
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went to him and bowed. Standing downwind from him, she said,
“Venerable Sir, women smell.”
“Well then, the nuns should clean themselves with water.” And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching,
after which she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow the nuns to clean themselves with water.”
Being aware that the Buddha had allowed cleaning with water,
a nun did it too deeply, causing a sore in her vagina.
She told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun clean herself too deeply with water?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“How can a nun clean herself too deeply with water?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun is cleaning herself with water, she may insert two finger joints at the most.
If she goes beyond that, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”

Feeling scruples because of Thullanandā, people there neither sat down nor lay down.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the Buddha had allowed bathing robes for the nuns.
Knowing this, the nuns from the group of six wore bathing robes of inappropriate size.

The training rule on reviling a group
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Caṇḍakāḷī was quarrelsome and argumentative, and she created legal issues in the Sangha.
But when a legal procedure was being done against her, the nun Thullanandā objected.
Soon afterwards when Thullanandā went to a village on some business,
the Sangha of nuns
took the opportunity to eject Caṇḍakāḷī for not recognizing an offense.
When Thullanandā had finished her business, she returned to Sāvatthī.
As she was approaching, Caṇḍakāḷī neither prepared a seat for her, nor set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, or water for washing the feet;
and she did not go out to meet her to receive her bowl and robe or to ask whether she wanted water to drink.
Thullanandā asked her
why she was acting like this.
She replied, “That’s how it is, Venerable, when one doesn’t have a protector.”
“But how is it, Venerable, that you don’t have a protector?”
“When these nuns knew
that no-one would speak up for me because I am not esteemed by them and I didn’t have a protector, they ejected me for not recognizing an offense.”
“They are incompetent fools! They don’t understand legal procedures, nor what makes them fail or succeed.” And in a rage she reviled the community.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā revile the community in a rage?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”

“I have satisfied the nuns. Come, and I’ll satisfy you, too.”
“How could you satisfy us?

“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can nuns do this?

and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, approval is required for an unmarried girl who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years.
And the approval is to be given like this.
After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that unmarried girl who is eighteen years old should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I, so-and-so, an unmarried girl who is eighteen years old, am training under Venerable so-and-so. I ask the Sangha for approval to train for two years in the six rules.’
And she should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This unmarried girl so-and-so, who is eighteen years old and training under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This unmarried girl so-and-so, who is eighteen years old and training under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years.
The Sangha gives approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years.
Any nun who approves of giving approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
That unmarried girl who is eighteen years old should be told to say this:
‘I undertake to abstain from killing living beings for two years without transgression. …
I undertake to abstain from eating at the wrong time for two years without transgression.’”
Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways for being difficult to support …
“And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

The training rule on disposing of feces
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a brahmin who had earned money by working for the king thought, “I’ll ask for my wages.” After washing his head, he walked past the nuns’ dwelling place on his way to the king’s residence.
Just then, after defecating in a pot, a nun disposed of the feces over a wall, and it landed on the head of that brahmin.
He complained and criticized the nuns,
“They are not ascetics these shaven-headed sluts.
How can they throw the contents of a feces-pot on my head?
I’m gonna burn down their dwelling place!”
And he got hold of a firebrand and entered their dwelling place.
Just then a lay follower who was coming out from the nuns’ dwelling place saw that brahmin with a firebrand on his way in,
and he said to him,
“Sir, why are you entering the nuns’ dwelling place with a firebrand?”
“These shaven-headed sluts threw the contents of a feces-pot on my head.
I’m gonna burn down their dwelling place!”
“But this is auspicious, brahmin!
You’ll get your wages and a thousand coins in addition.”
That brahmin then washed his head, went to the king’s residence, and he got his wages and a thousand coins in addition.
But that lay follower returned to the nuns’ dwelling place, told them what had happened, and then scolded them.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns dispose of feces over a wall?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“How can nuns dispose of feces over a wall?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun disposes of feces or urine or trash or food scraps over a wall or over an encircling wall, or she has it disposed of in this way, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”

At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a trainee nun went to the nun Thullanandā and asked her for the full ordination.
Thullanandā told her,
“If you give me a robe, Venerable, I’ll give you the full admission.” But she neither gave her the full admission, nor made any effort to have her fully admitted.

At that time out-of-season robe-cloth had been given to the Sangha of nuns,
and the Sangha gathered to share it out.
Just then the nuns who were pupils of the nun Thullanandā were away.
Thullanandā said to the nuns:
“Venerables, there are nuns who are away. We cannot distribute the robe-cloth until they get back.”
And she blocked the distribution of robe-cloth.
Since the robe-cloth could not be distributed until those nuns returned, other nuns left.
Then, when her pupils returned, Thullanandā had that robe-cloth distributed.

a family that was supporting the nun Thullanandā said to her,
“If we’re able, Venerable, we’ll give robe-cloth to the Sangha of nuns.”
Just then the nuns who had completed the rainy-season residence had gathered to distribute robe-cloth.
But Thullanandā said to them,
“Please wait, Venerables. The Sangha is expecting more cloth.”

‘Venerables, I, so-and-so, a married girl who is more than twelve years old, am training under Venerable so-and-so. I ask the Sangha for approval to train for two years in the six rules.’
And she should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and training under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval to the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old, to train in the six rules for two years.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old and training under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years.
The Sangha gives approval to the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old, to train in the six rules for two years.
Any nun who approves of giving approval to the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old, to train in the six rules for two years should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given approval to the married girl so-and-so, who is more than twelve years old, to train in the six rules for two years.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
That married girl, who is more than twelve years old, should be told to say this:
‘I undertake to abstain from killing living beings for two years without transgression. …
I undertake to abstain from eating at the wrong time for two years without transgression.’”
Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways for being difficult to support …
“And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun gives the full admission to a married girl who is more than twelve years old, but who has not trained in the six rules for two years, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
Who is more than twelve years old:
who has reached twelve years of age.
A married girl:
one who has gone to the place of a man is what is meant.
Two years:
two twelve-month periods.
Who has not trained:
the training has not been given to her, or the training has been given to her, but she has failed in it.

After each of the first two announcements, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When the last announcement is finished, the preceptor commits an offense entailing confession,

“Please come, Venerable, and resolve this legal issue.”
Thullanandā agreed,

The training rule on being stingy with families
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a certain nun was walking for almsfood along a street in the same town. She then approached a certain family, where she sat down on a prepared seat.
The people there gave her a meal and said,
“Venerable, other nuns may come too.”
Then that nun thought,
“What can I do so that other nuns don’t come?” And she went up to other nuns and said,
“Venerables, in such-and-such a place there are malicious dogs, a temperamental ox, and it’s muddy.
Don’t go there.”
Another nun, too, approached that family while walking for almsfood along that street. She sat down on a prepared seat
and the people there gave her a meal. They then asked her,
“Venerable, why don’t the nuns come here?”
And she told them what had happened.
People complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun be stingy with a family?” …
“Is it true, monks, that a nun acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can a nun act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun is stingy with families, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.

At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the nuns were giving the full admission to married girls less than twelve years old.
They were unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; contact with horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and creeping animals and insects; rude and unwelcome speech;
and they were unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and destructive of life.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns give the full admission to married girls less than twelve years old?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?”

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nun Thullanandā was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings.
Bhaddā Kāpilānī, too, was a learned reciter who was confident and skilled at giving teachings, and she was respected for her excellence.
Because of this, people visited Bhaddā Kāpilānī first and then Thullanandā.
Overcome by jealousy, Thullanandā thought,
“These ones, who are supposedly contented and have few desires, who are supposedly secluded and not socializing, are always persuading and convincing people.” And in front of Bhaddā Kāpilānī, she walked back and forth, stood, sat down, and lay down, and she recited and had others recite, and she rehearsed.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can Venerable Thullanandā intentionally make Bhaddā Kāpilānī ill at ease?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How can the nun Thullanandā do this?

The third training rule on unmarried girls
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to unmarried girls who were more than twenty years old and who had trained in the six rules for two years, but who had not been approved by the Sangha.
The nuns said this:
“Come, trainee nuns, find out about this,” “Give this,” “Bring this,” “There’s need for this,” or “Make this allowable.”
But they replied,
“Venerables, we’re not trainee nuns. We’re nuns.”
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can nuns give the full admission to unmarried girls who are more than twenty years old and who have trained for two years in the six rules, but who haven’t been approved by the Sangha?” …
“Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can nuns do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, approval is required for the full admission of an unmarried girl who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules.
And the approval is to be given like this.
After approaching the Sangha of nuns, that unmarried girl who is more than twenty years old should put her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I, the unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, ask the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.’
And she should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give approval for the unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to be fully admitted.
The Sangha gives approval for the unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted.
Any nun who approves of giving approval for the unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given approval for the unmarried girl so-and-so, who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules under Venerable so-and-so, to be fully admitted.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Then, after criticizing those nuns in many ways for being difficult to support …
“And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun gives the full admission to an unmarried girl who is more than twenty years old and who has trained for two years in the six rules, but who has not been approved by the Sangha, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.

An unmarried girl:
a novice nun is what is meant.
Two years:
two twelve-month periods.
Who has trained:
who has trained in the six rules.
Who has not been approved:

The training rule on the ending of the robe-making season
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time a lay follower had built a dwelling for the Sangha.
He wanted to give out-of-season robe-cloth to both Sanghas at the presentation ceremony for that dwelling,
but both Sanghas had already done the robe-making procedure.
That lay follower then approached the Sangha and asked it to make an end of the robe-making season.
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to end the robe-making season.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should end the robe-making season.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha ends the robe-making season.
Any monk who approves of ending the robe-making season should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has made an end of the robe-making season. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
That lay follower then went to the Sangha of nuns and asked them to end the robe-making season.
But the nun Thullanandā, aiming to get robe-cloth for herself, blocked the Sangha from doing it.
That lay follower complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns not end the robe-making season for us?”
The nuns heard the complaints of that lay follower.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How could Venerable Thullanandā block a legitimate ending of the robe-making season?” …
“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized her,
“… How could the nun Thullanandā do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:
‘If a nun blocks a legitimate ending of the robe-making season, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case.
A legitimate ending of the robe-making season:
a unanimous Sangha of nuns brings it to an end.
if she blocks it with the thought, “What can be done so that the robe-making season doesn’t end?”, she commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, and she blocks it, she commits an offense entailing confession.

Caṇḍakāḷī complained and criticized them,
“Why are you asking me if I’ve seen your things? Am I a thief? Am I shameless?
Venerables, if I took your things I would no longer be an ascetic. I would fall from the spiritual life and be reborn in hell.
May anyone who speaks such an untruth about me lose her monastic status, depart from the spiritual life, and be reborn in hell!”
